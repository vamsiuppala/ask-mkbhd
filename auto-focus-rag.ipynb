       "Document(page_content=\"Now honestly you can't go more than about 60 seconds in New York City without seeing a Cadillac escalade or something like that. And it's not that they're popular to drive or buy. It's just that they're popular to ride in like as Uber blacks, limousines, rideshare services, like these things are everywhere. And I've been saying they should make an electric escalade because all it just matches up too well. Like what do you expect from an escalade when you get in that thing? You're like okay it's an escalade. This should be big. It should be luxurious. It should be smooth. It should be quiet. And it'll probably be pretty expensive. And what do you expect out of a brand new electric vehicle like an SUV? Well it'll probably be big and heavy but also it should be smooth. It should be quiet. And it'll probably be expensive. Like it just matches too well. And so guess what? I just got back from the city where GM's stood there unveiling of the first electric escalade. It's called the escalade IQ. And I gotta say GM's cooking. GM has got a lot going on. And this seems like a pretty good match. So let me show you what I saw. Now to have you out of course this is a 2025 model. So like I said a lot of what I'm seeing here it actually isn't a real vehicle. I'd say it's more of like a visual representation of a bunch of promises that they're making. But there's a lot of really stuff here. So let me go through one by one. First of all the design. This is what it looks like.\\n\\nI mean it has a really big street presence kind of like every other new escalade which mostly are black. But this one is light gray with an optional black roof. Honestly it just reminds me of like a jumbo size lyric. Like if you remember the lyric I viewed a few months ago it had a certain look to it. It looked pretty high tech. It felt also pretty underrated. This has a lot of lyric vibes. Just scaled up a lot. And then with a few escalade touches. But like if you've seen an escalade you know how big these things are. It has those like vertical tail lights which play these nice little animations when you walk up to it. It's got this nice light at the top of the back. But also the front has some nice lights. It's got the lights in the grill and the logo which are just like the lyric but then vertical headlights from the escalade. So it's just like someone skilled up a lyric and Photoshop by like 150% and then added some escalade touches. So specs. There's basically just one spec. It's one powertrain at launch. It's going to be a dual motor all wheel drive setup. It's going to have an absolutely gigantic 200 plus pillow at our battery. They didn't specify exactly but this thing is going to be super heavy. And it's going to have a targeted 450 mile range. Even with these enormous 24 inch wheels. So that is really solid and I think it still will be in 2025. So there's some aerodynamic bits here and there to help make this happen.\\n\\nMostly just these gigantic built in arrow caps built into these wheels so it can slip through the air a little more efficiently than just the classic refrigerator design. But yeah this this equals huge. The battery is huge. It'll do 0 to 60 in under 5 seconds thanks to a 750 horsepower and 785 pound feet of torque in max velocity mode. And it'll fast charge this huge flat back here is the charge port on the left and just look how small this little charge port looks in this absolutely massive rear end of the Cadillac. It's absolutely wild. It should be able to add 100 miles of range in 10 minutes and support bidirectional charging. Not sure if this will be an NACS port by the time this comes out but I'll keep an eye on it since that's something GM promise that they would adopt Tesla's charging port. But yeah okay so this thing has adaptive air suspension so this is a normal height but it can raise up an inch for comfort or drop down by 2 inches to let people get in more easily since this thing is so tall. It also has a real front trunk which the rear didn't really have and it's actually pretty huge. It's got a 2 cubic feet with this huge opening and it's pretty narrow. It's got a power outlet inside. Allegedly it can fit a full set of golf clubs maybe even two. All I really know is from looking at it is it's pretty shallow but also pretty deep. So you can definitely fit a good amount of stuff in there as covered lock storage. And then it has four wheel steering standard.\\n\\nSo these rear wheels will actually turn up to 10 degrees to dramatically shorten the effective wheelbase of the car and help it turn much tighter which is honestly pretty sick in New York City but also just in general makes it feel a little bit smaller. And it will also literally do crab walk mode just like the Hummer EV although Cadillac will call it something else. I think it's called a rival mode and it'll help you get in and out of parking spaces more easily. It's pretty funny this thing is just like a Hummer but for the city. And then there's a bunch of luxury features inside. This is even less final but you know since it's Cadillac you can kind of trust a lot of what we're getting into with the quality of materials leather and metal everywhere. And then for this IQ we're doing a huge continuous touchscreen for this dashboard across the front of the car. It's big but I don't think it's too distracting because it's not super tall. Also I'm seeing there's still some traditional controls for your air vents and radio and lights and stuff like that. They'll have Google software on what they're calling a 55 inch diagonal touchscreen but that's really more like the 35 inch ultra wide touchscreen for the driver and then a little bezel and then next to it a 12 inch touchscreen for the passenger. And I'm actually told this is crazy but I'm told that this passenger screen will be polarized so the driver can't even really see it when it's on and be distracted by it.\\n\\nI've never seen that before but sounds like a good idea if it works. And then you know looking around there's a good amount of storage. There's some behind this second controller touchscreen, some underneath in between the driver and the passenger there's just a bunch of it's a huge vehicle so there should be a ton of storage. And then this model that they showed me has the executive back seat option so this second row is even more fancy with these screens on the backs of the headrests and the center console in between them but a lot of people will probably just get a normal second row with a gap in the middle that leads back to a third row behind them that also power folds flat. There's a huge static glass roof. It doesn't open but it's a glass roof it less than a lot of light for the front two rows and then it doesn't quite make it to the third row but it's still a roomy third row from what I can see. And the trunk space behind the third row is solid too which shouldn't be a surprise because again it's an escalator this thing is huge but now you can see it. And then there's some other little quirks like all four doors can be power opened by the touch screens which I mean if that is a new feature I don't know what it is and the driver's side door will actually automatically open up when you walk up to it with the key fops so it just presents itself open.\\n\\nAnd there's up to 40 speakers inside this thing if you opt for the highest end AKG sound system including a bunch in the door and I'm sure there's some here even in the headrests of the seats probably some butt subwoofers too. But this whole thing is going to start at $130,000 again it is an escalator it is expensive that's not really a shocker. I was kind of tempted when I first saw like the pictures of it to compare it to the Rivian R1S. I call that basically the best SUV you can buy it's three rows as well but this is like a whole price bracket above that. So it's premium it's bigger it's more expensive but I really can see this quickly becoming well liked in the community of people who already drive escalators around every day. Oh probably a very popular limo in New York City but that's it. Let me know what you think. Would you have done anything differently with making the electric escalator finally that they're pulling off? I think GM's kind of cooking right now. Well played the lyric and now this. Sweet. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/The_Electric_Cadillac_Escalade_IQ_450_Mile_Range_.txt'})"

       "[(Document(page_content=\"Okay, so here's the thing about a minivan. Everyone can agree on one thing, which is a minivan is very practical, very livable. If you need to go on a trip or if you have a lot of people you're taking with you, a big family, car seats, minivans are like the most livable thing, but nobody really wants a minivan. That's beyond us. Like you get one out of practicality, but you're not really desiring a minivan. But what if you could get a minivan in disguise? What if you could get a practical 3-row SUV that has all the features of a minivan, but isn't a minivan? Now we're talking. So this here, this is the Kia EV9. It's actually two different specs of the EV9, but I've been living with this thing for about a week now, driving it every day, and I'm telling you right now, it's not missing anything. 3-row, fully electric SUV, full size, lots of space, and all the things that you think of when you think, okay, minivan, here's what I need, here's the space I need, the features and practicality I need, it has all of it. But then of course you have to contend with the fact that it's electric and it's a Kia, and every time I do this, I review a Kia and it's like, this is the highest end, fully option GT, it's like $75,000. If you take the Kia logo off of it, I think we can all agree, very compelling. For the cheapest 3-row fully electric SUV, it's really good, it's not missing anything.\\n\\nBut then you put the Kia logo back on it, and then you think, hmm, do I want to spend $75,000 for a Kia? But stay with me, I think you might be convinced by this one. So first of all, there's several trims of this thing. This is the one I've been driving in this ocean blue, which I think looks sick, but I'll get to it in a second. Over here, we have a lower end trim, which has a little more silver trim. It actually has a metallic paint job, but slightly fewer options. This thing starts in rear wheel drive at $55,000. It's called the light. Then there's the wind, which is all wheel drive. That's $64,000. Then the land is $70,000, and then the GT, this is basically fully optioned everything you can possibly get, starting at $74,000. But now think about its competition, because I'm driving this the whole time thinking about the other options you could get as far as three row fully electric. You've got Tesla Model X, Rivian R1S, which I love. I've done a video about that. Then you've got maybe the future escalade when it comes out, or maybe one or two others that are right about to come out. This is the cheapest one. But they've really managed to cram a lot of stuff in here. Then it's just a materials choice. So first of all, I'm going to start with the key. I've showed you guys the key before I review the EV6, but the same idea here is got, I mean, first of all, I like this key because you can sit on it in your back pocket, and not accidentally hit any buttons. Small detail.\\n\\nBut you got that lock button there, pretty sweet lights. Then if I have the car locked here, and I flip it over, and I hit that whole button, so I got to be really close to it just to make sure it works. But I hold that for a few seconds. It lights up, and then I can hit forward or backward. And it'll actually move the car by itself into or out of its parking space, which is pretty cool. There's nobody in the car. But I'm sort of a dog walking this fully electric full-size vehicle wherever I want. Let go, move it backwards, I guess. I have to be close to it for it to start. But let's move it backwards. Go ahead. Go ahead, move it back into the spot. Perfect. And part. Easy. It has the lights on the front, which is a good opportunity to show you that. These little pixel lights on the front here light up in a different welcome animation based on whichever one you choose in the settings. Now I already liked and showed you guys how much I liked the other electric he is. I think they're one of the brands doing the best job at like reinventing themselves with a new aesthetic for their electric vehicles. And the EV9, I think, is just as good looking as the other stuff too. It's got this little animation stuff happening, but also these big DRLs. It's beeping out because it doesn't like leaving the lights on, but now it's turning off. Also you might have seen that move.\\n\\nThat's some active aerodynamics to open up and let the air in for cooling some stuff or to close it up to be a little more aerodynamic. And just walking around this thing. So the fundamentals are great. Big long wheel base, as you can see, but basically the same length of a body as a telluride, just more space between the wheels. So then between those wheels is a 99.8 kilowatt hour battery. It's going to get an EPA estimated 270 miles of range. I found that to be close to accurate, maybe 250-ish. It's pretty big. And then the GT is going to have the most horsepower, 379 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. And that doesn't sound like a lot for something that's pretty big, full-size and electric, so it weighs a lot. But it is still pretty zippy for a dual motor all-wheel drive, three-row, not quite mini-van. And then they've been doing this interesting look with the wheels. I'm going to go over to this one first because it's even more distinct. It's got this silver triangle sort of aero cap look on the wheel. This is what he is doing to try to make their EVs look a little more modern and distinct. And it looks weird at first, but I kind of don't hate it for some reason. Then I'll come around to this one over here. And this one's a little more normal looking, but it's all black. And I almost at first thought I could remove these little panels here like they're plastic, but nothing seems to come off. So it's a 21-inch wheel on the GT.\\n\\nAnd this is about as aerodynamically efficient as you can make it on the front. Well, there is a front trunk, by the way. This is a ground-up EV and they have left enough room to put stuff in the front. It's not very big. I don't know how much you're going to use this, but in the rear wheel drive versions, this is about twice as big. So it's like a backpack space here now, but maybe a full carry-on if you don't have the all-wheel drive version. But close that. Come around the side. You have this black mirror cap here with the blinker. Like a light on the side. These auto recess when you're driving. And these are some big doors. And I was just noticing how heavy they are when we were opening these doors and closing them, but huge, seal, huge door here. And we'll get back to the quality of materials in a second. But all this black trim on the GT, I think, looks nice. And then look at that side profile. That's good. It's not a minivan. It's not a minivan. But if we get around to the back here, you can start to see it looks maybe a little more standard. I'll show you those tail lights. I still think they look pretty good because they're these big tall tail lights here. But maybe that's a little more mini-vany from the rear profile. Fine. Same as a tell-you-ride, a little bit, I guess, a little bigger. But okay, power opening, rear trunk, behind the third row. And let me know if you think that's practical enough for you. Again, there's three rows in here.\\n\\nSo this is just a storage behind the third row. So that's definitely enough for a couple of bags, maybe some carry-ons back here. Obviously, groceries will fit. There's also a tiny little bit of a sub-tronk. So that's already kind of occupied by some stuff. And you have your charging cables right here. But also, full on outlet back here. And then some buttons to power fold the second row, which you can't reach from back here. So that's good. But folding these back seats as easy as grabbing this. And if the headrests are down, then it folds flat right into the back space right there. So this is going to start to feel minivan. But I think practical is the way we're looking to use here. So now, two rows of seats and a lot of rear trunk space. But I want to pull these back up because I want to show you guys what the inside of the car is like with all three rows up. So you kind of have to do this with two hands. Pull this rope back up and then let go. But let's make our way to the inside because it's more impressive than walk around the outside. So let's get into EV9. It's kind of tall. Nice little roof rack. Also, how is it always so loud here? Okay. Inside the EV9. So a couple things stand out right away. If you've seen the EV9 review a lot of this will be familiar. But some of it's actually even better. It's more updated. It's more spacious. But there is a good amount of plastic.\\n\\nSo if you're not okay with a lot of plastic and a $75,000 vehicle, this one might be a little bit of a bummer. But again, my key is it's not missing anything. Like it has every feature I would want in this trim. So that also does mean there's a lot of buttons. But if I put my foot on the brake right in here, that's where you power it up. I was kind of not really into that positioning. I kind of would either want a button around here somewhere or just no button at all. Foot on the brake. But you know, leave these these days. They've got power buttons. I'm glad that these are physical buttons too. So you can bump up the temperature or bump it down right here and you've got your fan speed up and down. So I love that. That's always good to see with HVAC controls. But then it starts to get cool. Down here, look at this. This is a USB port, USB type C port right here. But you've got a button right here to switch it between battery so charging only or USB data to the car and battery. So if you just want power to charge, boom, you're there. If you want data for your screens, then that's there. Push button. I've never seen that before. Actually, that's kind of cool. You've got the storage in the middle. And of course, you can see all the ambient lighting kind of around the middle of the car. This little garage door slides back. It's kind of plastic, but it still works. It does what it's supposed to and this push button makes cup holders out of this space.\\n\\nSo if you want to organize it a little more carefully, you can do that or just let it be free open space if you'd like to. I'll close that. My phone's down here on the wireless charger and that's your indicator to make sure you're charging. If that out, it turns off. You've also got your camera controls. You've got brake auto hold, a fingerprint reader to log into your profile. And my favorite part down here, the pedals have a plus and a minus button. Just, you know, because you're going forward and then breaking. So like more and then less energy. I don't know. It's plus or minus speed. But basically all this paneling is, it's pretty basic. Like this is what you'd find in a Honda Odyssey plus a little bit of lighting, right? It's there is no real leather in this car. So all this is going to be fake leather and, you know, plastic feeling, but you've got a heated steering wheel. You've got heated seats right here. Love that. Memorize two different heated seating positions as well. Also ventilated seats. It's not missing anything. What else do you have? You have the opposite of the Fisker. You have a gigantic sun visor here, which has a gigantic mirror and a huge light. That's actually kind of soft. You also have an HUD up there, which is very welcome. You also have a mirror here, which can be a regular mirror or a camera mirror. Love seeing that, especially if you have rear passengers. You probably want to go with the camera mirror.\\n\\nYou also have a manually shaded or wide open sunroof that opens and is motorized. So that's pretty sweet. Also back there you can shade even more glass above the back passengers and very welcome to see wireless car play and Android Auto. So again, my phone's over here, not plugged in, but guess what? Car play. Works great, especially if it's down here on this where I was charger. But I actually want to give a quick shout out to Kia's software. This might be my hot take of this video, but I think Kia... All right, bro. Chill. I think Kia's software might be the most responsive. Definitely top three most responsive car software I have ever used. Because you know how sometimes you watch car videos and people are like, oh wow, the infotainment, it's very smooth, it's responsive and then they swipe. And it's like 12 FPS and you're like, we have iPads that look better than this for $200. Like what are you talking about? This is actually really good. So again, you can jump in car play, but look at this. This is actually pretty good. You jump into maps, you can jump into all the media stuff is here. Plus you still have like car play lined up here. Now I'd never use the maps built in. That's... It's not great. But if you do and you navigate to a charger with the built-in nav, it will actually precondition the car's battery knowing you're about to get to a charger.\\n\\nSo if you do want that to happen, you have to use the built-in maps otherwise maybe run them at the same time with car play. I don't know. Anyway, this is a lot of screen. Like 30 inches of screen, but it's touch screen all the way to this point right here. So you do still have like HVAC controls if you want to jump in here and do AC and temperature and sync up and do whatever. All that stuff is still indicated on that touch screen, but then all this touch screen stuff. This is actually good. I don't know why you'd want weather in the car. You're already outside, I guess. I don't know. The future weather, I guess that's neat. You have a search, which works decently well, but you can find some features. Not all of them are actually going to show up. Media, setup, it's good. This is car play. This is the media that's being pumped into the car right now and then set up for a bunch of other basic stuff. So vehicle stuff, settings, if you have EV stuff, that's your charging, which your battery status is currently at. This is good. I am very happy with the software in the EV9. Now, I don't want to forget about the rest of the space in this car because real quick, these driver seats, while they're not leather, they are very soft and they're comfortable. They even have these like active bolsters where if you go into sport mode or go over a certain speed, they'll hug you.\\n\\nThey'll do a little bit more and these headrests, these might be the softest headrests I've ever felt mainly because they're like gel and they also kind of have this mesh so they're kind of like a herm and miller office chair. It's really good. But of course, there's more rows. So let's go to the back seat. The second row seats is going to be really telling about how much space is in this car. Big heavy door. Let's jump into the second row. So now I've got myself a good amount of leg room, plus little storage here behind a 6-3 driving position. And I'd say that's a pretty good spot for a road trip, not too bad. If I close this door here, comfy. And interestingly, this is the six row setup. So it's two in the front, the captain seats in the middle, and then two in the back. You can also get a three row middle, but I think a lot of people, many van people, you know, this convenient access is pretty nice. And these chairs, I saw some other videos of these particular chairs in the EV9 swiveling around so you can like face the back seats if you wanted to or like put a car seat facing the other way, whatever. It doesn't do that in this vehicle in the US. I think anywhere in North America, it might just be Korea. So unfortunately, these don't swivel, but they do have armrests and they do have nice headrests, and they're comfortable too. Now the third row test, that's the fun one, because I remember the back seat of the R1S. And even though I like that vehicle, it's pretty small.\\n\\nPut the headrest up. This is also pretty small. So 6-3 here, 6-3 here, 6-3 here, not great. I don't really want to be in the back seat of this for more than a couple of minutes, but if you have some smaller people like, let's say, what many van people usually have. Oh, I don't know. Kids, then this is totally fine. In the back seat still has multiple cup holders, USB type C, speakers in the back. It's got the air vents everywhere. It's got that glass roof over the top. It's not missing anything. But let me crawl back out of the back seat real quick. I'm already getting cramped, but there's still some stuff I want to show you. Obviously, second row is more comfortable. You have all this ambient lighting you can see here, the blue and green, sort of and right look. And this is harder with one hand, but I can show you that there is storage back here. There's a drawer, so you can put stuff here. Or if you pop this back, storage inside this thing. So you can keep your charging cables or whatever other stuff you want to put in there. Pop that closed. Nice. In a lot of ways, this is the easiest spec of this vehicle to review because it just has everything. It even has not a huge screen, but a little screen overhead for your air conditioning controls for the back seat. Turn up, turn down temperature, whatever you want to do, fan speed. You also have these little nets over to the side on the windows to the left or to the right.\\n\\nSo if you want to mesh, give yourself a little bit of a shade. Sunshade's there. Also, USB type C on both of these seats for the back seat. And if you want to bump up your legroom a little bit, you can even move that passenger seat forward backward from a button on the side of it from the back seat. So I am honestly finding it hard to say that I would pick the Rivian R1S for anything much more than just build quality. The Rivian is obviously, well maybe it's not obvious, but it's quicker. It has 800 something horsepower, so it should be quicker. It's more off-road capable. But if you look at all the sort of a minivan spec, minivan capabilities, like, okay, it doesn't have air suspension, but the dampers on this thing are tuned very well to the point where it always drives soft. It rides really nice. It's got these big wheels, but it absorbs pot holes. It's got this nice sophisticated rebound. It sort of drifts a little bit over bigger bumps, but other than that, it's fine. It just rides smooth. Now in case you're wondering, I know most people who would buy a minivan or an EB9 probably don't care, but there is a drive mode button right here, and if you press it, your drive modes are normal, sport, my drive, snow, and eco. So I think in eco, you can decouple the front and rear motors, and sometimes be only single motor drive, which is going to be more efficient. I can go back to normal, and normal just drives around as soft and pillowy as can be no problem.\\n\\nThis ability is great. Speakers are pretty good, a little bit lacking in base, but honestly totally fine. I talked about the camera mirror already, like, dang, they thought of everything. Man, I think Kia has been shockingly high on my power rankings of electric cars that I would buy. They have truly, let me lock it. They have truly reinvented themselves with the aesthetics and the feature set of their electric cars. Now word on the street is there's going to be an even faster GT version of the EB9. That's insane, totally unnecessary. That's cool too if you want that. Probably will have less range though. But as a general power rankings for three-row electric vehicles, if you made me pick one now, again, you're picking between R1S, 90 grand, Tesla Model X, 90 grand, and this, 50 to 75 grand. So you can say yes, I'm paying a lot of money for a Kia, but also you could say I'm not paying a lot of money for 250 to 280 miles of range, 200 plus Kilowatt charging, not a lot of road trips, basically a minivan, fully electric, totally silent, smooth, three rows, a lot of space, a lot of features. This thing's pretty good. What do you think? Which one would you pick? Thanks for watching. Get to the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/The_Kia_EV9_is_Surprisingly_Good_.txt'}),\n",

       " (Document(page_content=\"Alright, so I feel like last time we did this video, last time I sat in this car, in this parking spot, on an Android phone and talked about EVs. I was talking about how the state of EVs is held back so much by charging. I could have got all these great electric cars, but I was talking about this experience of charging them being dramatically behind. This Tesla has got this huge advantage where they have built out this huge charging network and they have spent the billions and billions of dollars and now it is so much better to own a Tesla and drive around and charge using their network than it is to use any other, any public network, any electrified America, all that stuff. But clearly that has changed, so this kind of feels like a sequel to that video, so let's talk about what's happening here. So in North America, this is specifically North America, the ports that I'm talking about apply to North America here, but in North America we've got Tesla with their charging port, which they call NACS, the North American charging standard, but it's Tesla's port, they own it. And then there's everyone else, and most of them are using most amazing CCS, this open standard. And because there's so many Tesla superchargers out here that no other car other than Tesla's can use, a question that kept popping up was, when are we going to maybe be able to charge other EVs on Tesla superchargers? Wouldn't that be sick? Wouldn't that be a win for everyone?\\n\\nIt would be better for all of those EVs and Tesla could charge for it. And Elon kept tweeting about it, like, oh yeah, we'll make it available someday, sure. Yeah, oh, we're allowing it, we're allowing it, but like it never happened. And then a couple of weeks ago I made that video on the like three or four chargers that opened up Tesla superchargers with this magic dock. That had a CCS plug on the end so you could plug in any CCS car. There's like three or four of these chargers. And that was kind of cool, and that made my Rivian 3% better, but it was not very many chargers, but now we're starting to see this wave of actual collaborations with Tesla that are much more meaningful. It started with Ford, then it was GM, and then Rivian, and I'm starting to think by the time I post this video there might be another domino to fall, but essentially what's happened is the CEOs have gone, all right, you know what? Tesla superchargers are so far ahead and are so good that you know what, we're just going to put Tesla's port in our cars, and we're going to make Tesla superchargers available to all of our cars. It's not every single Tesla supercharger, but it's thousands of them. It's meaningfully, dramatically better for these cars. So like this started with Ford, right? And Ford CEO basically collaborated announced this and was like, all right, yeah. So starting in 2025, all four EVs will switch from the CCS port to Tesla's NACS port.\\n\\nWow, sick, and they'll be able to use thousands of Tesla superchargers and can still use the public charges if they want to, if they're willing or brave or daring enough, they can use those two, they can get a CCS adapter. But basically they become much better cars because they work on Tesla superchargers now. And then GM did it. And so that's all the Hummer EV and all the Cadillac lyrics and all of those. And then Rivian today was the last domino to fall and there'll be more. But yeah, this is this is a game changer and my take on this honestly is this is a win for everyone. So I can we can literally break this down who it's a win for. First of all, it's a win for us, the EV driver, because let's just take the Rivian, for example, I feel like it's pretty obvious that it's a much better product now that you can confidently road trip in a Rivian in North America. Because Tesla superchargers are that good, the uptime is that much better, they're that much more reliable. I just think that's a no brainer. That's a win for us people driving these cars or driving the cars of the future with that port. It's a win for the companies doing this like Ford GM and Rivian so far, because now all of their cars are better and all of the cars are better options because let's be honest.\\n\\nI think a lot of people would agree that these vehicles are better than the vehicles, Tesla's making so if you prefer a pickup truck or a five row of seven cedar SUV, whatever these options are that Rivian or Hummer or or Cadillac or these others are making. These are better vehicles. So now all of them become better and more likely to be bought by people who want to use them all the time. That's a win for the companies making them they'll get more customers and then it is a win for Tesla because of course they're getting paid. The logics of them getting paid are pretty straightforward, but they're even behind the scenes things like of course, okay, you'll need a Tesla account, you'll pay the ten bucks a month, you'll pay for the charging kind of like a gas station, Tesla's the new gas station maybe. But they're also I believe potentially eligible for government subsidy money. The government is paying for a bunch of charges to be made and they have to be able to charge lots of different cars to be eligible for the money. So they're going to get a lot of money for that to Tesla wins might might only be a little bit too much of a win for Tesla when you look forward into the future at potential monopoly status. But there's a couple of things to consider. Rivian is one of those companies who has said they're going to continue investing in and building their own network their adventure network.\\n\\nEven though they are now going to be switching to any CS and they also I remember I talked to RJ the CEO on our podcast and one fact and listen to that episode real quick. Check out this clip real quick where he actually addresses Tesla superchargers. There's been a massive under investment in charging infrastructure. It's just like a couple of Tesla chargers that have added this adapter that can work in a show up in the map, which is great. Do wish there were more open on Tesla's network. Yeah, I think that I think more will open on Tesla's network. We've the Rivians can charge on that on Tesla's network where they're open. The way I think about it is over time, I hope charging starts to become more ubiquitous and it becomes less of an issue. If you asked me, it sounds like he had a hunch that this was coming or that this was a possibility. But the point is the density of chargers available for all of these cars just got dramatically better or at least will be in 2024 and 2025 when they switched to the new port. And that's a win for everyone buying those cars, everyone driving those cars and the port itself is really good. I think that's a little bit of an underrated thing, the thin cable, the incredibly well made chargers in the first place and the more easily maneuverable end of the cable. It's a good plug. So I see this as a pretty pretty much a win all the way across the board. Yeah, so this this feels like a good sequel slash part two. I'll leave it at this.\\n\\nI still do actually hope that public chargers slow level two chargers and all sorts of other chargers that are just sort of floating around that aren't in the Tesla network continue to get better because one, I think there will always be a delta between all Tesla Superchargers access or some Tesla Superchargers access. I believe Tesla has to keep some for themselves to have some advantage to buying a Tesla over another EV. I think that will be their main advantage. And I also just want Tesla and charging in general just be better across the board. And so if you watch the rest of that interview with RJ, he talks about them investing heavily in their own charging network and putting them in specific places that make sense for rivians. Rivians are adventure vehicles. So you won't really find Tesla Superchargers at national parks or in forests or campsites, but you will find Rivians adventure network there. So they can be more specialized and if you buy a river, it'll make sense to use those sometimes. So I hope that investment continues from these companies, but now they kind of have less pressure to do that mass highway adoption of just putting these things all over the place because Tesla's been doing that. It's a good look. Who do you think is the next domino at a fall? It could be lucid. It could be Hyundai. It could be Mercedes, pole star. Maybe even there's a lot of there's a lot left on the tail, but I think we're going to see some more, which is a good thing.\\n\\nAlright, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/The_Tesla_Charging_Takeover_.txt'}),\n",

       " (Document(page_content=\"All right, so pretty much that's the beginning of this electrical revolution of cars. We've all sort of thought about and we all kind of wanted like a $25,000 high quality EV experience. And we've for many reasons not gotten that yet and that might not happen for a real long time. But right under our noses this entire time, right under our fingertips has been, well, the most affordable electric car that I think you can reasonably recommend. And that's the Chevy Bolt. And it's right here. I've never actually gotten to live with one until this video. This is the Chevy Bolt and it's the EUV version. So it's a little bit taller and a little bit longer. And this is the first time I've gotten to check it out. It's called the EUV that stands for electric utility vehicle. That's what we're working with here. And it's got this sweet red and black trim too, which is a little bit of an option, but I'll take it. This is also the first auto-focus video I'm shooting on Pixel 7 Pro. Let's see how it goes. So my very first impressions of this guy have actually been very positive. And we're working with, let me just give you the basics right off the top. So it starts at around $32,000. All right. And for a $32,000 GM vehicle, you're not expecting like the highest quality materials on planet Earth. But what I have noticed is, and you'll see this once we get inside, a lot of the, just the straight up list of features that you actually get is very good. It's really well equipped.\\n\\nSo first of all, the basic specs are about a 200 horsepower powertrain. It's front wheel drive. And it's going to get you about 240 miles of range, realistically about 220 miles of range driving normally. You can see it's got that hatchback shape. It's got these smaller wheels. You can see this is what this is what they're called. It's an EUV SUV crossover hybrid type thing. Not an unreasonable shape, but this is what the bolt EUV looks like. There's also plenty of badging like they are not afraid to put bolt EUV on it. And with the red line package, it's red and black, which is nice. It's got the red and black stripe there going on. Also up at the front wheel and right on this mirror here. I don't mind that. But yeah, bolt EUV. For under $40,000, what should you do well in an electric car? Well, the range I think is a good place to start 250 miles, 220 to 250 is nice. It doesn't have a front trunk, but it does have a good amount of storage, which I'll get to in a second. And then just the list of features is very well equipped. For this price, again, you're not expecting, I'm going to get to the interior, but you're not expecting like amazing leather and like massaging seats and all this. Like it's an economy car, but this is a very well equipped economy car. And I think this spec we're looking at right here is about $36,000. Probably the biggest place that it's lacking compared to its slightly more expensive competitors is fast charging.\\n\\nIt does fast charge, but I believe it's actually topping out at 50 kilowatts, which is not the fastest fast charging in the world. So if I was doing a road trip, that's going to take you closer to half an hour to go from 10 to 80 percent instead of the quicker 15 minute type bursts. So it'll keep you waiting longer if you're doing trips like that. But other than that, let's just get into all the things I think it does well because there's a long list. So first of all, storage. So I said there is no front trunk, which is kind of unfortunate if you're expecting one. But if you pull up that assisted lift gate, you'll see there is a decent amount of space. It actually doesn't look like much right now behind the back seats, but the seats can all go down. And then there is of course a sub trunk underneath. You can probably just take this out if you want to entirely, but that's a good amount of grocery space, things you don't want to slide around underneath here. And then you can just pop that down, cover it, and you're good. So storage is actually a pretty solid amount on this car. And then you know, I'm just going to say it. I think the design is a plus point. It's not a huge plus point. This isn't some beautiful sexy sports car or anything, but it's not bad. You've got this grille front that kind of reminds me of the Mustang Mach E. Shout out to the golden hour of the blacked out Chevy badge. Hives the cameras pretty well. You don't need much of a grille there.\\n\\nThere's your vents. And it does some quirky things with the lights. So I'll hit that unlock button. And it does play a sort of animation. But basically what I've noticed with the character that the bolt has with these lights is both at the front and the back, there's like two sets of lights. There are the running lights and the blinkers, which are in one spot. And then there's the actual headlights, which are underneath. And that's also true about the back. Hold on, look at this. So this is the back. Look, you think just driving behind this car that that and that are your brake lights. But no, that is your actual brake lights. These are just your ambient lights that are on while you're driving. So that's kind of, oh, I don't know, quirky thing about this car. But it's got some character. I like that it has that. Let me look on the inside though. So this is the interior of the Shelley bolt 2023. Now, like I said, we're not expecting a super high quality leather and Alcantara and all sorts of crazy things like that. So this is going to have what I would call a normal interior at this price. It's got plastic everywhere. It's got full leather with things that look like stitching, but it's just normal looking car interior. That's fine. Plenty of plastic and fabrics. But what I'm going to say again is this is a very well equipped car. At no point when I was driving this car or living with this car, that I ever feel like I was missing anything.\\n\\nIt had a lot of equivalent experiences to what a Tesla Model 3 or Model S today has. I daily drive a Model S still today. And pretty much everything that I'm used to in those cars is in some form in this car. Stay with me. So put on the brake, push button, start over to the right here. You've got a screen behind the steering wheel and a screen over here, which is a touch screen, which has all your infotainment. Steering wheel and some normal stocks. In GM cars we're seeing this paddle here for extra regen, just to pull that and get that extra braking, which is cool to have. But then you've got your controls down here. This is a one pedal driving button to turn on or off that full on one pedal driving regen, which is cool. Your parking brake, your drive, neutral, reverse, and park. And also just a little, I don't know, you could put some change in there. I don't know why these buttons are shoved up here and so huge. This is your sport mode, your lane guide assist, and also your traction control off button is absolutely gigantic, which is hilarious. But it is what it is. You have your storage in between the seats here, which is nice to have. Just a plastic container, two cup holders, since the 360, I should probably mention. Shout out to Insta360 for sponsoring today's video. I'm using this X3 here to show off a couple of certain shots to see in this video that I normally wouldn't get with the smartphones. So learn more about that camera at the end of the video.\\n\\nAnd also you can click the link below to see their holiday offer. But we'll get back to that. But you can see there's also a wireless charger up here, which I always like to check. Yes, does support and charge huge phones. That is an iPhone 14 Pro Max. And there you go. It's charging. It'll also work with the Pixel 7 Pro. Big phones will work here. So then this car has heated and ventilated front seats, heated rear seats, a sunroof that opens and closes, and has a shade that you can stop at any point. It has, obviously, the seats are adjustable, power adjustable. And then you come down here to the front. There's a heated steering wheel. And then there's this whole Android Auto or Apple CarPlay situation. Both of them are supported. I happen to have an Android phone connected right now. But this works pretty smoothly and fluidly in a way that I like to see, although I'm mostly spending my time in Android Auto. Although I want to mention over here, these knobs right here. This is a volume knob, which is cool. I like being able to just quickly change the volume with a physical knob. But there's another knob here. That's just to change your point select, just to move around as if you don't have a touchscreen right here. So if you wanted to, for some reason, use this knob to select things. You could do that too. I don't know. Volume button's up here though. Cool. This bolt already even has something that might test them out of less.\\n\\nPlad just got with a software update, which is this leaf right here when you hit the leaf. It shows you a breakdown of how you've been driving and what different parts of the car are using the most energy while you're driving. So you're driving technique, which is how much you're accelerating quickly. And how many miles it's taken away based on what you're expecting, how much the terrain, your altitude going up and down hills, outside temperature and HVAC and all those things. And also while you're driving, it'll show a live preview, whether you're using regen or not or taking energy out of the battery. All this stuff happens. It's not the most beautiful graphic in the world. It's definitely not an expensive looking system as you just interact with the software, but it's here. It's not missing and that's the point. And I'm glad it's just here for me to check out. Also every time you finish a drive, it gives you this little view of like how your drive was and what sort of stuff you used up the most energy during your drive. You wonder about the backseat? All right, let's check out the backseat. I know you probably think this is a tiny backseat because it's a tiny car. Which it's a small car, but it does have a reasonable size of backseat. So let me go ahead and sit a six-dream person in behind a six-dream driving position. And I bet that's better than you expected. I mean, I know it's better than I was expecting.\\n\\nYou know, again, it's not a dramatic amount of like EQS level room in the back, but again, heated seats back here if you want. And again, this sunroof is going to be shaded if you want it to be or open and letting light in. I think that's pretty sweet. Not bad. And as a backseat experience, you get USB-C and USB-A. There's also this cup holder in the middle here. The only thing really missing from the backseat, in my opinion, is HVAC controls. It's not that big of a car so you could argue, don't really need them, but you don't have separate AC and heat back here. But yeah, nice seats, heated back seats, that's pretty good. So what's it like to actually live with and drive this thing? Okay, it's not that thrilling. It's very, it's very utility. It reminds me a lot of like its competition is basically Nissan Leaf, Volkswagen ID4, and something along the lines of, I mean, Ionic is much more expensive than this. Like, you really are fighting for under 40 grand, and there's not a lot that actually genuinely compares to this at that price number. If you're looking at like a model 3 or something like that, yes, that will be more sporty and accelerate faster. But I've been fine driving this around, and again, for what you're getting for the money, 200 plus mile range is rock solid. Now two things. One, I am a little interested in why it's front wheel drive. I would have expected them to either do rear wheel drive or all wheel drive, but it is front wheel drive.\\n\\nAnd two, this actually does have supercruise, which is their driver assist feature that works on certain mapped out roads, depending on where you're at in the US. There are some roads that it works with here. So when I say this car feels like it's not missing anything, you know, if you were to get a Tesla or something that has some basic autopilot features, you will still have exactly that in this less expensive car. I think the disadvantage with supercruise is it works on way less roads, and it basically just does highway. It's at this point for me, but it works the same way. It does not do lane changes, I found, but it does everything else. It follows the car and front of you. It follows the lines on the road. It does a pretty good job. And this camera has actually just literally watching you as you're driving to make sure you're paying attention. So it does that. I mean, it has all of the basic stuff that you would expect out of a car at this price. It doesn't overdo it as far as modernness. It's got plenty of reasonable buttons here that all makes sense. That's your climate control HVAC stuff. I want to be easy to do while I'm driving and not necessarily looking. Again, you have your your infotainment system is solid, and the leaf tells you how you're driving and based on certain factors, how you can do better. So yeah, not really missing a whole lot here with the bolt. It's just bringing everything a little bit down in price.\\n\\nIt's funny when I write the column on top here for summarizing summarizing my thoughts on these vehicles when we get to test them. One thing I get to say every time I review them is if I were to compare it to any reasonable household electronics object, what would I compare it to? And when I have the Volkswagen ID for here, I compare it to a toaster of because it's just pure utility. No one's getting it for the excitement of driving in the sport mode or any of that stuff. It's just like, all right, does it have the storage, does it have the miles, does it charge reasonably fast, does it get me planning to point B? Yes, yes, yes, check, check, check. What's the price? I'll take it. It just reminds me a lot of that, but it takes it to the next level. It is much more attainable and affordable. I think we're kind of sleeping on like the $30,000 bolt as the most affordable best version of a cheap EV you can get. I'd like to just throw that out there. We should probably use this as a baseline more often. But yeah, in the quest on our way to the eventual dream, which is probably in like a decade, having a $25 to $29,000, 300 plus mile fast charging sporty electric car. We'll get there someday, but on our way there, we're going to need more good ones like this. Should have a bolt impress me a lot. I'm happy to say. Let me give a shout out again to the Insta360 for sponsoring this video. This is the way that we were able to get some of those shots that you saw.\\n\\nIf you want to get one of these cameras again, if you're shooting on your own like I am, you will get a lot of shots that you would typically miss because it's constantly shooting in 360 degrees all around the camera all the time. So if you want to check one of these out or pick one up, I'll have the link right below. If you use the link below, you'll actually get some bonus items with your purchase. And also if you want to watch a little bit of a video on how we use the Insta360 to get some of those shots, there's a new video right now on the studio channel of a little bit of behind the scenes of this exact autofocus video, how we shoot it, and how we got some of those shots that you saw in this exact video. A little bit of metaphor, just a little sponsorship meta, thanks Insta360. So that's it for this one. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys later.

       " (Document(page_content=\"Alright, let's do it. Let's talk about a Mustang. We have to revisit the Ford Mustang Mach-E. And I wanted to do this for a couple reasons actually. One is it turns out, I mean I'd played with it off camera a long time ago as it was first being released, but since then it's become one of the most popular, most well-liked, and probably most solid EVs of the past couple years that you can buy. I see them on the road all the time, and actually since then it's about to get, or it's gotten depending on when you watch this, two major updates. One hardware and one software. It's really interesting. So let's get into it. I want to just talk about why I think this has done so well, and then those updates. So first of all, in this video what you're not going to hear me do is talk again about the Mustang name. It's a Mustang, okay? That's, it's just a part of it. I'm not going to talk too much about it, but there are a bunch of reasons why I think it's, it's pretty clear in hindsight why this thing has been so successful and so popular. Probably just starting with the shape, the form factor. We all know this is what America loves is an SUV like this, or a crossover if you want to call it that. But then second of all, it's really nailed a lot of the EV fundamentals. And for a lot of people getting their first EV, which this is their first, it's got to nail the fundamentals and it does that. It's got a 70 kilowatt hour battery.\\n\\nThis spec is landing people, depends on your trim and your wheel size, but anywhere from 250 to, at the top trim, gets like 300 miles on a charge. So that's really solid. It has a front trunk. It has a good storage space, and it's that crossover that's kind of destined to be popular in America. Let me show you the trunk. Well, I'm not going to talk about it. I'm not going to talk about it. Oh, I've done this before. If I open the trunk, but I'm standing too close to it, the sensors think that I'm in the way, and it doesn't open. So I got to stand back a little bit, then open the trunk. And it opens. And you get a good amount of storage space. There's a second row back here, obviously, but they really thought about it. There's your charging equipment, wall charger. But then pop this down, put your groceries in, solid high floor. This is a good amount of storage space. This is the stuff you look for in a fundamentally sound car. It's built by Ford. Everything is well built. Nothing really rattles or shakes. The material choices are good. It's solid. So let me talk about the first update. The first thing, which is a hardware update, and that is with charging. So, if you get a Mustang Mach E today, these have what's called the CCS charger, and they max out at, obviously, the range is really solid, but they do top out it. I think it's 115 or 120 kilowatts of charging speed, which in today's world of EVs that charge at 200, 250, 300, 350 kilowatts.\\n\\nIt's not that fast, but the major update coming to the Mach E is that, well, all of Ford's EVs starting in 2025, as we talked about in the last video, are adopting Tesla's NACS port. So, Tesla's port, that's going to enable them hopefully to charge much faster, but they'll be able to charge on all of Tesla's superchargers. Public chargers are also getting better too. I was really happy to hear the sponsor of this video. Flow is focusing on offering over 98% network up time, and they have a free app on iOS and Android that lets you check the status of over 70,000 public chargers across North America, thanks to interoperability with various charging networks. So here in New York City, Flow has over 100 of these curbside charging stations that they make, and people seem to really love them. And they're keeping track of things like the roughly 30% utilization rate, and some of them with over 99.9% up time. Also, Flow makes a residential product too. The Flow Home, which shares the same ruggedness and reliability as the public charging stations. So, feel free to download the Flow app, thanks again to Flow for sponsoring. So I look forward to a charging update on the Mach E starting in 2025, and that's a big deal for this vehicle. All the ones that are sold between now and then, I believe you just get an adapter, and that's still going to be able to charge pretty fast, but that's something to keep an eye on with software.\\n\\nBut then let me get inside and show you something different with the, sorry, that's hardware. Now let's do software. You may also remember that this has come from the sort of era of early EVs where like you have to do something weird or different with the door. It's always lights and door. This one, they have a no real traditional door handle. You have the key in your pocket, and you just press this button right here. It unlocks, and then you can pop it out like this, and you sort of just pull it by that tab. Then we can get into the Mach E. So really on the inside, nothing's changed too dramatically. I'm not going to talk about it. But I'll plan out a few things. Now that I've been living it again with a few weeks, it's sort of been reminded of some things. First of all, again, is Ford's build quality. Like this screen in the middle is just rock solid on here. You still have this volume knob, and the software actually lets you change, I don't know, copyrighted music. Let's you change what it controls based on context. So if I turn on the HVAC here, now this wheel controls temperature, which is pretty cool. I turn that off. I turn that off. Now suddenly, this is going to go away, and it's going to become my volume control again. So it's context sensitive, which is cool. I also really like the placement of these wireless chargers. They kind of tilt towards you a little bit, although this does have wireless Android Auto and CarPlay, so you don't need to be on those ports.\\n\\nPut you out of them if you want them. And this little bit of storage down here, this door, very well made. Just everything is solid. The seats are comfortable. It's got a little bit of carbon fiber trim up here as well. Real air vents. Pretty nice combo of real buttons versus touch screen. All this stuff is still what you expect from the Machi. You see pretty high off the ground still, people love that. You've also got this expansive gigantic sunroof. It's this shape, and it's the things that are pretty standard in a lot of EVs now, but again, when this was early in EVs, and this came out, this sort of set the tone for what to expect from a traditional car manufacturer, making electric cars. Again, it's got a front. It's got everything going for it. A lot of extra space in the middle. Well done. By Ford. And now I got to talk about the software update. So this is one of the few cars that we've started to see come out that actually gets over the air software updates. And what I've been driving is a Machi with actually the brand new latest about to be released. So I guess I'm technically baited testing this. But the about to be released version of Blue Cruise 1.3. So every car out now, if they've got the latest software is 1.2. This is the latest version, which does have some actually pretty interesting new features. But Blue Cruise is their adaptive sort of self driving. I would say not self driving. It's their level to highway cruise driving assist feature.\\n\\nAnd this has the latest version of it. So here's what I'll say. Every one of these companies has to sort of mitigate risk and decide how much they want their system to be able to do. Tesla being on the far end of like we want your car to be able to drive itself from point eight to point B. And Blue Cruise is much closer to the other end. It's much better than it was before. But this literally only works on highways, certain highways and certain parts of certain highways. But what it does when it's on those parts of certain highways is really, really smooth. So it does this new thing that I found was really interesting. Obviously if you're in the lane, it'll hold its lane. It'll drive just like a normal car on the highway. It'll keep assistance from the car in front of you. All that good stuff. And if you put the blinker on, it'll check your shoulder. And if there's enough space, it'll move over. If there's nothing in the lane, it'll move over and you put the blinker off and you're good. So that works as intended. What I found really interesting, is they've been trying to make it more smooth and more natural. And because they have all this data now from these cars being out for a while and people using Blue Cruise, they figured out when people are most likely to disengage this software. And one of the most common times that people disengaged it was when they were passing or being passed by a large vehicle like a truck.\\n\\nBecause they felt like a little too close to it and they would disengage it and sort of move over a little bit to give it a little more space. Just because it may be a little twitching, you don't really feel super comfortable being that close to a truck. So what this does, now that they know that it does that, is it tries to act a little more natural like a human. And anytime you are passing a truck or about to be passed by a truck, something like a large vehicle is next to you, it moves over a little bit within the lane. So it's smart enough to know whether it's in the center, the left side or the right side of the lane. And so I had noticed if a truck was on the right side of me, this whole car would move over a little bit to the left side of the lane to give the truck a little more space. And it sounds like such a small thing, but that little natural engagement. And even a little bit of a little bit of a graphic on the screen itself showing that it's doing that made a really big difference. And I was far less likely to disengage it. This is honestly some of the smoothest highway driving from any system I've ever tried, which is super cool. And that's been basically the major improvement with Blue Crews 1.3. Other things are like it works in more difficult situations, more poorly lined roads, night time driving, some of the weird rainy stormy driving we've had over the past couple days. It does much better and is less likely to disengage in those situations.\\n\\nBut yeah, generally really good stuff. I hate how many cars make me hit the button to turn it off. I'm going to open the front trunk real quick. But yeah, I think that's generally been my consensus with this car is it feels like a lot of what has to be true about the best-selling EVs is they have to be pretty boring. And I don't even mean that as an insult. I just mean people are most comfortable when a new car is familiar to an old car. This is one of the few rare front trunks in a traditional car manufacturer's EV. Get fit like two duffle bags in there, a carry-on bag, or a roller bag in an airport. But the point is like when you get people buying new cars and they act a lot like their old car, people feel the most comfortable. And I think that's a lot of what Ford's done here. And that's a lot of what you'll see with these manufacturers who have made tons of other cars. And I think they did a really good job with the Mustang Machi. Let me know what you think. Are you looking for a big update on the Mustang Machi? Or are you looking at some other EVs? Because I kind of think they did a great job with this one. Either way, thanks for watching. Catch you later. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/The_Electric_Mustang_Got_2_Huge_Updates_.txt'}),\n",

       " (Document(page_content=\"So what type of cars are you usually into is the question that I usually get now that we have this autofocus channel and we talk about all these different cars and the answer that I usually give is high-tech cars. That's the sort of generic version of it, right? A lot of electric cars are on the forefront of this so they come up a lot but just anything high-tech in a car is interesting. And I think that actually does still apply but also this one came up completely randomly and organically because I just kept seeing it on the road and I was like is that is that a Prius? I don't know if I've is this the new Prius and I eventually I had to ask and check it out and I guys I think the new Prius is kind of sick. I don't know if I'm crazy for this one but I really had to check it out and now that I've been driving it there are a lot of really cool features and tech in this car and I completely get it.\\n\\nI want to talk about this as a hybrid so a lot of people go straight to EVs as the highest tech cars because they typically are but let's be honest not everybody is ready for an electric car right away right they're expensive they are for the most part still relying on the infrastructure you need to be able to know you're gonna be able to charge wherever you go and so for a lot of people they're not ready for an EV yet but they are in the market for a car and the stop gap between them is a hybrid and this is sort of the king of hybrid world maybe not the king of hybrid world but it's the most familiar hybrid to most people this is the Prius prime meaning it's a plug-in hybrid it has 44 miles of electric only range you can plug it in and charge it up and never sip the gas at all but it does also have a gas tank for 400 plus miles of gas range it's got something crazy like 55 miles per gallon and it actually looks kind of good this time so let's check it out look at this thing man this this is the Toyota Prius prime the 2023 there are a lot of really good angles to it but I think in general what's happening here is they've given it very EV styling despite it not being fully electric so I'm gonna hit the the lock button here so you can see the lights the ambient lights have this sort of a check mark we've seen a lot of these in new cars the headlights are below them and I think it's got a pretty good front facing look the only weird part about the front honestly to me is this\\n\\nthis big hub on the windshield wiper looks kind of weird but then it's got this big slope this big sloping windshield right from the front of the car all the way to the top and the back of the trunk which is a hatch it's got these big wheels it's got these 19 inch wheels you can see the brakes in there nothing too crazy and on this side is a gas cap this is actually the handle to get into the back seat we'll get to that in a second on the other side is gonna be your electric charge port door no crazy fast charging again it's a pretty small battery so just regular CCS you can plug it up just like that but here is another good angle the back of the Prius I think it looks good wait let's see the lights those you're left and right and you can also I'm gonna open the trunk actually this is a good opportunity to show you the hatchback so what's funny about this car is this is maybe the slowest opening hatchback I've ever seen but I also noticed it has the fastest opening and closing windows I've ever seen so I'll show you that in a second kind of random but you can fit charging equipment over here this is a tiny bit of extra storage in the Styrofoam but a reasonable size trunk I would say and obviously this is the the cover which you can pop out and actually fold in half and put on the floor if you don't want the cargo cover sort of privacy cover but I think it has a good look with this sort of a tail light bar here at the back this entire left to right width which turns on when\\n\\nthe car is on and I'm liking it so that's the Prius Prime.\\n\\nSpecs wise it's not even like a ton has changed about the Prius it was 130 horsepower before now it's 220 horsepower it's still slow it's still like a seven seconds error to 60 you're not getting this car for how sporty it is you're getting it for how efficient it is and for just how little you will pay to think about fuel but there's one more X factor because this Prius that I'm testing and I didn't even realize this until it showed up has one more trick up its sleeve which is solar on the roof well well dusty right now because we just had a storm but a solar panel on the roof that actually contributes to the car's drivable range so let me tell you about that I took this car for my daily commute which for me is about 29 miles and it was full at 100% I drove it all the way to the studio 29 miles and I had 40% when I arrived I didn't use any gas pure electric when I got here I left it out in the sun and I haven't driven it for the weekend because I had an ultimate for the road trip we went to Boston Montreal came back so it's like two and a half days later and it has 52% battery actually gained meaningful battery just by sitting out in the sun so this is maybe the only shipping production car I've ever seen with a solar panel good enough that if you actually drive it around with a short enough commute you might never actually have to plug in and pay for gas it's it's a small amount that you gain in range every day so let me show you you put the foot on the brake you hit power\\n\\nand this is the inside of the Prius it looks very familiar to some other Priuses I've never actually lived with the Prius before so this might be a very familiar to previous Prius owners but there's a screen up here behind steering wheel it's obviously very visible it's riding realign sight as you're driving normal driving stuff the software which I think is pretty solid and then a good amount of physical tactile buttons you've got temperature control you've got heated and cooled seats so whichever you choose up in the front there's a little bit of a cubby here which if you pop this back has a hashtag hidden compartment cool cup holders this little gear selector here which is interesting you kind of have to move it over and down to drive or over and up to reverse or just hit the button to park and there's a wireless charger in here for your phone so let me show you how that works because I thought it was kind of clever there is wireless Android Auto so you can do this and actually still have Android Auto you plug your phone in over and it sort of leans over to the side so there are these like guidance pieces of plastic here and it does say wireless charger and you pop that over and it leans your phone to the side and you can see it's charging and you can hit a button to turn that on or off so that's cool you still have all the typical controls here yes there are drive modes yes there is a sport mode I don't think most people will drive this in sport mode most of the time but\\n\\nin terms of typical interior stuff like a lot of plastic a lot of the typical 30 to $50,000 car price range stuff here these are a little bit nicer seats thing you might have seen in most pre-specs but this is again the highest and pre-us and you've got this LED strip across here which blinks to make sure you've got attention on the road because this can't be watching you while you're driving so the couple things I want to show you in this car one is the windows so just so we can confirm this is the fastest window I've ever seen in the car done just as the just the time it takes to open and close it's a pre-us guys there's not a lot for me to talk about in this car but I do want to know that that is pretty impressive the roof is obviously not a center because there's solar above me but let's look at the the UI for the solar so this is their software pardon the blinking that doesn't usually look like that it's just a solid red line in real life but this is the maps it's pretty reasonably usable it's Google Maps UI I think the data is really solid so I like using that but of course I still prefer wireless Android Auto over this it is more responsive and more functional but you have Bluetooth audio if you want to select your audio source here if you ever phone connected you can do that stuff but then there's all the other settings over here energy flow while you're driving will show you yes right now I am filling up the battery with solar and if I go to solar this is the really\\n\\ninteresting part just by sitting in the sun today I've added 506 watt hours of battery doesn't sound like a whole lot it's half a kilowatt hour and I am literally generating 32 watts of power right now which I don't know might be enough to charge my phone but if you look at the totals for how much you're adding per day and actually sort to distance you can see this is a rainy day this is a storm that we had but just today by 3 30 pm I've added about two miles of range to the battery and so I've got over here my battery meter I'm at 50% battery as I told you before and so I've added 2.2 miles other days with fully like sunny days you've added over four miles of battery to the range so let's say you have a I don't know a five mile commute seven mile commute you theoretically with enough sunny days in a row just straight up won't pay for gas or electricity I feel like this is one of those things that I don't talk about too much in cars often because when I see a solar panel on a car it feels gimmicky it was on the Mercedes like world record car it was on I saw it on the app Terra I've seen it on a couple other cars that aren't shipping the the karma Rivera have one like I usually don't see solar panels on cars and when you have an electric car the battery is typically in the realm of a hundred kilowatt hours a hundred thousand watt hours so to add 500 watt hours in a day doesn't seem that significant it might only power you for a mile or two but this is a hybrid which means if\\n\\nyou ever do run out of electricity you switch over to that gas and you can just go forever it's like a nice backup a nice intro to electric driving that's what's so cool about it so okay a couple of the last second things I noticed that are interesting about this car one it doesn't have the best visibility I've ever seen in a car it does slope quite a bit and you can tell that it's a sloping roof line but what's nice is it has a couple features one is there's a regular review mayor and you can see the visibility is decent but that can actually switch to a camera feed because there is a separate camera on the back of the car just for the review camera that is kind of nice to see and then second when you back the car up or put it in reverse there's this really nice view and it is this sort of a top-down view and when I drive it actually fills in the transparency of what's underneath the car so now I've fully filled in and I'm basically driving a transparent car around then it can show me what's underneath the car what's where I just was when I parked this big transparent car it's super easy so I appreciate that and then driving it around actually notice something got to hit the off button it depends on what car you're driving a lot of cars get different types of looks or different reactions around the Prius is interesting it's a new Prius so it did get some people looking at it because of that but sometimes when you drive a sports car around you get a lot of people pulling up\\n\\nat a stoplight revving they want a race or they want to hang or whatever on the freeway and that's a thing the Prius kind of has the opposite effect where because it's a Prius everyone tries to cut in front of you in line everyone thinks that you're the one that they're gonna get in front of on the entrance ramp to be the last one to join where they're supposed to kind of weird stuff that happens also there's a nice noise that it makes when I hit that lock button so it's not a horn like you'd usually have it's just a chime which is kind of cool I guess but that's the Prius honestly I am on I'm on board with the fact that hybrids right now in 2023 are a decent stopgap on the way to people getting more electric cars electric cars are expensive they're still range anxiety and they're still infrastructure questions and the Prius clearly makes a lot of sense and in this new package this new suit it's got on I get it I like the Prius man all right that's it thanks for watching kitchen the next one peace\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/The_New_Prius_is_SICK_Solar_panel_roof_.txt'}),\n",

       " (Document(page_content=\"This car is almost perfect. It's so good. I love it. I've enjoyed it. The time I've driven in it has been awesome, but I could not recommend it because there is one thing that is a deal breaker. It's a pretty classic deal breaker. So let's talk about the Kia EV6 GT. So I started seeing a lot of EV6s around on the road. I got really curious about it. This is the GT version, so it's the slightly fast, well, a lot faster, sportier, more fun to drive version of the EV6. But I'd seen these around. I got curious about it. So getting to actually drive it was going to be really eye-opening. And I never thought I would like a Kia this much. I think that's what it comes down to. This is a really, really solid and unbelievably fun vehicle to drive. So let's get into the good things and you'll see what I mean by the deal breaker in a second. So you can see by the shape what the EV6 is. It's a hatchback. It's four doors. It's got a decent amount of space and it's fully electric. And then like I said, there is a regular EV6 that's not the GT. So a couple of ways to be able to tell that you're looking at a GT version is these vertical slats and these design details up here in the grille. These are also vertical design details. There's a little bit more aggressive angles. The rear diffuser looks a little better. But the easiest way is the neon green. So these brake calipers 21 inch wheels. It's on winter tires right now, but the neon green definitely GT.\\n\\nAnd then it has the same shape as the regular EV6, which I really like. It's kind of a teardrop shape. And in general, looks quite nice. It's like kind of a model Y height. That might be its most direct competitor. A little bit lower than my Sangmaki GT. But then also back here, you've got the sporty spoiler. So that's another way of seeing you've got the GT. This part here sort of tilts up and acts a little bit like a spoiler. And then you've got EV6 over here and GT down there. Honestly, I think it's a great looking car. I've seen a lot of actually a lot of satin ones on the road. There's like this satin gray color. This one, this red one here is called. Can we read that? Runway red? Pretty classic cherry red. But let's get more into the details. So first of all, to hatchback. This is the key for it. I've seen some of these keys that have this like forward and backward out of parking spaces. I've not been able to get them to work unfortunately, but the rest of the keys pretty solid. Hold here to open the hatchback and we'll get a look at those lights. And getting into the back of the EV6. There's a good amount of space. So a pretty classic telltale sign of way of knowing that the car that's electric that you're looking at wasn't built from the ground up to be electric. Is if it doesn't have like extra features over the gas powered version. Like this one that it has a tiny front trunk, a little 20 liter front trunk.\\n\\nBut honestly, I think the space in the back here of the EV6, it's a little less than the GT because it's got a bigger rear motor. But I would say that this is pretty good still too. The tire mobility kit and show you tiny slot down here for charging cables and a good normal amount of room for grocery use. These all fold flat. For a $65,000 car, it'd be cool if these wouldn't. Oh, let's see if I can. Okay, they won't come back up automatically, but that's a good amount of space. That's a good amount of space. There are no lights in the trunk, but you do get that button to close it. And here's a better look at the rear at the lights, which I also really like. Nice tail light bar all the way across here. This is the blinker. And this is the electric charge port, which I do have to go into the car to open, which I wish there was a button on the key for it, but right here anyway, push that. And it's an almost CCS port, which is probably a good time to address the elephant in the room, which is this car's biggest downfall, which is its range. I didn't quite catch that. Could you please say that again? I said it's probably a good time to address this car's biggest downfall. It's range. So the EV6 GT has more powerful motors and is faster and sportier than the regular EV6, but it didn't get a bigger battery pack. And so with its 77 kilowatt hour battery, it has a max range of 200 miles, 200 miles. It does have 350 kilowatt charging.\\n\\nIt is a pretty accurate 170 to 200 miles on a full battery if you charge 200 percent every time. But that's about half of what I would hope to get for $65,000, 200 miles. So that's the challenge here. Like this is the shape of a really practical everyday type of car, which the EV6 is. It's got the back seats and we'll go inside in a second, but it's got the performance and the fun and the sportiness combined with practical just minus the practical range to do any sort of road tripping. Maybe you can do like commuting every day. I've done commuting and I have a 30 mile commute and it's gone well before the end of the week. I have to recharge. So this is something to think about. It's a deal breaker for me. I couldn't recommend or buy this, but now knowing that, let's get into some of the more interesting details here. So it's got these door handles that sort of pop out. Look at that. We can get in. Nice little entrance. And here we are in the cockpit of the EV6 GT. There's a power button here. It does say EV and that's your power. And then this is your drive shifter to shift to drive or to park. Break hold, parking cameras and music. No, no, no. So okay, some things that I love here and some things that I don't. First of all, there's a little bit more GT happening. There is a GT button on the steering wheel, which will change drive modes. And I'll talk about the driving in a second.\\n\\nBut there's also, you'll notice, these really sporty GT bucket seats, which are very comfortable. They're really nice. They're also heated along with the steering wheel with three different levels. And that's also great. But generally, this like neon green thing is how you know you're looking at a GT. And I do really like these seats. Shout out to the back seats, which are also heated, not ventilated, but there's also a full-size power outlet back there and a good enough legroom. Good materials. It's a Kia. I mean, you're going to be pretty used to the classic like glossy plastic brushed metal, but fake plastic again. Plastic here. A lot of plastic up here and some rubberized materials. This is this is probably where you'd say you don't want to spend 65 grand on a car like this. But I do think it's well put together. It's just not expensive. Materials now we got to get to this part. This is the part. This is the auto focus part right? The technology in the car and how you interact with it. I could give this whole system like a B- or a C plus up here. It's going to remind me a lot of the Ionic 5. So this is a relatively responsive pieces software. It's your computer. You do have the screen behind the steering wheel, which is great to 84% 176 miles. This is the Achilles heel. I mean, I've seen as highs like 213 miles, I think, with 100% battery. But you can dig in the settings here. The navigation is decent and it will navigate you to chargers and you can do a whole bunch more.\\n\\nI say this because yes, this car has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. But it's not wireless. Okay. So there's a nice little spot for the wireless charger here. You can pop your phone in there. It fits a huge phone. This is an S23 Ultra. This turns orange when you're charging. It turns green when it's done charging. But then this is my navigation and it doesn't beam it up here wirelessly. Instead, you would have to use one of these two cables down here, which means your phone is going to end up down in this tray. And as you drive around, it kind of slams around in there, which is not ideal. So you could do that and it'll charge your phone wired and you'll get it up here. But this is like a natural place to pop your phone when you get in the car. So it's kind of unfortunate that it doesn't have wireless car playing Android Auto. Nevertheless, the software is capable, right? It's got even these crazy settings that will do the sound that the car makes as you're driving. So how it responds to the accelerator pedal, the exact sounds that it makes. You can kind of do this rumbling sound if you're into that. The bottom line is there's a lot here and it's fine. It's fine in the layout. I wish there is the wireless car play element, but that works for me. You also get your parking cameras here and you do have a little walk around camera. So you do get a white one no matter what color your spec is, fine, whatever is functional. It works.\\n\\nThis is a very wide angle camera, but it's also functional. You get used to it. So yeah, generally pretty good software. This part though, a little annoying, I will say, because by default, you can see that says volume power. And when I change this, it's a volume knob for your audio. My phone's connected. That's going to be volume. HVAC controls, I must go in and hit this little notch here to switch it to HVAC controls. Now this is a temperature selector, right? So this little knob has two different functions depending on if you hit this touch target or not. It makes sense. You can get used to it. It's just this little touch target is kind of small. So sometimes I'll jump in the car and think I'm doing one thing, but if I miss, then I'm doing the other thing suddenly the lines way up when I want to turn it up with the heat. You know, a little bit of nitpicky, but this is the type of stuff that I think you could probably improve with a few more real switches or real buttons. I think Ionic 5 kind of learn the same lesson. It is what it is. But let's talk about driving. So this is turned out to be probably the most fun EV you can drive under 70 grand. I'd say that because the only other option there would be like mock egt, Tesla model Y, the Taycan is is every bit as fun, but it's very expensive. So that's going to come down to your performance figures and how capable this Kia is. I've been very impressed.\\n\\nThis is first of all dual motors all wheel drive, 580ish horsepower, talking about 0 to 60 in low to mid threes, and it pulls. It really keeps pulling just a blast to drive. And then on top of the straight line performance, very balanced and very fun and engaging to actually move around. So you've got this drive mode button here on the steering wheel. You can hit that and see that it switches between these three drive modes, Sport, Eco, and Normal. But if you want to have a little bit more fun, I mean, this changes a bunch of settings all the types of things like the suspension, dampening, softening, accelerator pedal, responsiveness. But as soon as you want to have a little more fun, there's this GT button over here. Press that GT button. Everything turns the neon green. So you might not have noticed this, but you can kind of see these little things lighting up here. There's a lot of ambient lighting all around the car. For these three modes, it's Eco, Normal, those are blue, Sport turns everything red. But then neon green GT is going to be your full power. Traction control turns off by default. And it lets you have a little bit more fun with the way this car can approach its own limits. And it's sick. Now the one other thing you can get out of this GT button is a personalized my drive mode. And the cool thing about that is you get to choose every single little thing. So steering response, acceleration response, suspension.\\n\\nSo I have everything in Sport Plus, but you might want to do Sport Plus, but with a softer suspension or with a little bit more traction control. All these types of things can be adjusted in your own driving mode. And that's the one that I drove in the most often. That's also the one that's going to get you, you know, roughly 200 miles of range. Eco can get you a bit more. And it does appear to turn off the front motors in Eco, but it doesn't it doesn't do a ton as far as total range you can get. So it's a car you have fun in and then have to charge very quickly. In its sportiest setting in the GT mode, the car, it seems to shrink around you. It feels smaller than it really is. Even though visibility is great, and there's a glass sunroof in everything, I just mean like it feels very nimble and tight quick. And then you saw GT mode has traction control off or at least reduced. So it allows for some slip, you know, some understeer, some playfulness. I love it for back roads because it really lets you stay on the power more through curves and play with it a little bit. But that's unlike the sport mode, which is closer to a lot of other cars, which, you know, cuts power, limits any slip, and most of the time keeps you planted when the wheel is turned. Either way, it's great to have both. And the bigger brakes on the GT are also great. Maybe my only nitpicky driving complaint is that steering is, you know, kind of video gamey because there's not a ton of actual feel.\\n\\nBut also the firmest suspension setting is just a little bit bouncy sometimes, just a little bit. There is also a drift mode. I didn't try it. It's in New Jersey on winter tires. I'm not trying to do that on a public road, but it's there. Oh, also such a minor detail, but on the steering wheel, this is volume up. This is volume down. Makes perfect sense. This is previous track, and this is next track. I think that's backwards. But you know what? That's the idea. That's what a lot of people are looking for in a car, right? Let me just open the front trunk real quick so I can at least show you it. The combination of practical and fun, practical and fun. I think with this Kia, you get 75% of the practical and a 90% of the fun. I think they maybe could have gone to the absolute maximum of practical if they had designed this around having maybe a little bit more storage space up at the front. I mean, that's literally almost nothing. You could fit a bagel in there maybe. But the fun part is pushed about as far as I think you could at this price. It's awesome. So if I'm thinking about who should buy this car, who would I actually recommend this car to? Not a lot of people would want to drop 65 grand on a Kia. Let's be real. But the people who would spend 65 grand on this are also going to be considering things like the Mach E GT, the Tesla Model 3 performance or Model Y performance. Things in this price range that are high fun and high practical.\\n\\nAll of those will have more range in this, dramatically, every single one, like by at least 100 miles. And so that's going to be the Achilles heel of this GT. It's so much fun and it's just such a pain to charge two thirds or 60% more often than the others. I really wish I could love it more. But that's the thing. That's holding it back. That's the thing, Kia. It's the thing. It's so close. Please make a version with 110 kilowatt hour battery or something. This is 77 and you charge up to 100% every day and it does this thing but please make a high battery pack version. Please. Okay, it's my only request. That's it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/Kia_EV6_GT_Almost_Perfect_.txt'}),\n",

       " (Document(page_content=\"Alright, we got a fun one today. What we're looking at here in this video is the most efficient electric car ever made. It's a prototype car, but it's super cool. It's called the Vision EQXX Spammer Studies. It's right here with me. Not a lot of people have seen this thing. And the reason I want to look at in this video is because there are a lot of things that they add to do in the name of efficiency to get as much range as possible on one charge that actually translates to electric cars that we see today. So a lot of what I'm going to walk around and show you guys, you can trace to a lot of the other cars we've seen while electric cars are shaped the way they are, why they do what they do. Hopefully there's not too much noise while I shoot this, but let's take a closer look at the most efficient electric car. The only one to get so far a thousand kilometers of range on one charge. So this is the car. This is what it looks like. And there are a lot of things I want to point out here. First of all, the shape. So electric cars are shaped a certain way in a lot of ways because they're trying to slip through the air and be as aerodynamically efficient as possible. So they're already heavier than normal, but if you want to maximize how far you can go, you need to minimize the resistance to going that far. And so there's two main factors for resistance when you're driving a car like this. Those would be rolling resistance with the tires on the ground and air resistance.\\n\\nSo when we look at air resistance, you look at this frontal area and this has the lowest dry coefficient of any car ever. Again, this is no production car, but 0.17 and there are a bunch of reasons why? Mainly because this is entirely perfectly optimized, literally in every square inch to be as efficient and smooth as possible. Look at this. So let's start down here at the front. First of all, you've got what looks like a pretty normal face. You've got the headlights and you've got this bar light across the front. But then you've got a bunch of aerodynamic elements. These two flaps right here can open or close on command based on how fast you're going. And the entire idea is to get the air to slip over the top of the car as smoothly as possible with as little turbulence possible. So you've got these outlet areas here to relieve the pressure as air goes through the front. So there's no front trunk. This logo, this logo is a sticker, which does two things. Say it's a little bit of weight, but also doesn't disturb the airflow as it goes over the hood of the car. You've got these side curtains over here, which means air is going to go slip in here. And a huge reason on a lot of these cars, electric cars that you see with, I'll say, uglier. Not the best looking wheels is because they're trying to be aerodynamically efficient. And this is just about as aerodynamically efficient as you can possibly have a wheel.\\n\\nThey have specially designed tires with a rounder front area and lower rolling resistance. They're pretty narrow. And so when the air gets through this channel here, it smoothly goes over the side of this tire through that channel and bends around the car with no disturbance. Again, this is not a car that's like shipping today. This is more of a demonstration of what happens when you combine all of the different optimizations you could possibly throw into one car to be as efficient as possible. So certain cars today will have a sort of a balancing act where they use some of these things to be efficient, but then have to make sacrifices on other things. So we'll keep going down the side here. This is a pretty small, side view mirror. And you might have seen that there was a previous version of this car that had a camera. What they told me is that they switched to be small side view mirrors because when you have cameras instead of mirrors, you do get a little bit better aerodynamics, but that also means you need to show the display on the display in the car, the feed from the cameras all the time. And that amount of tax on the system was roughly the same as the amount of energy saved from using cameras instead of mirrors. So we have small, efficient mirrors now, which is cool. We'll do the interior in a second, but you have flush door handles, which of course is going to help you slip through the air even better.\\n\\nHere's your back door handle, back flat wheel, and then you get to the back of the car. And here, this is that, this is that long tail design. This is really slipping through the air. So when we get to the back of the car here, this is really more along the lines of things that you would really only see in a prototype like this and you would not see at least currently in a car on the roof, maybe in the future, but at least not current. Because what you're looking at is an extremely long footprint and this entire sloping shape, it is kind of sporty, but it is designed to sort of be shaped like a tear drop in the most aerodynamically efficient shape possible. And then you get to the back. Yes, there are rear lights and you can see those lights vision EQX X up here, but down at the bottom here is a bit of an active aerodynamics hack. So there are certain cars with longer tails and we've seen these. This specifically is the rear diffuser of this car because the bottom of the car has to be aerodynamically efficient just like the rest of it. And when they actually extend this rear diffuser out, you can choose to do that at certain speeds or just manually enable it, that gets you a few points of aerodynamic efficiency. It actually brings it from point 1.8 to point 1.7. So the whole back of this car gets a little bit longer when that active diffuser sort of pops out. So now we should talk for a second about solar panels on cars.\\n\\nSomething you might have seen if you've seen this car in the Presto 4 is there are solar panels up in this whole greenhouse here. So it's got this really nice soft a pillar sloping up to sort of cut through the wind. And then from here you've got solar panels all the way over the back of the car all the way down to the back here, which is cool. But like I said, cars these days are making a lot of trade-offs in the types of things they want to add. How many of these factors are they going to include to be the most efficient car possible? And I hear a lot about adding solar panels to electric cars you might have heard about the app terror and things like that. I'll just say I don't really buy the idea of only going by a solar. I don't think it's realistic in most climates to get all by. It's just a math equation basically to be able to drive entirely on solar. But if you do have enough solar area you can actually offset some of the energy required to drive. This entire sheet here which is a massive amount on this car can on a sunny day in perfect conditions which not this. Give you 300-400 watts of power which is pretty good. But as I was raining here I'm just going to open this door handle and pop inside so you can show you the interior of the car and talk about driving efficiency. So this is a cozy interior definitely for a couple of reasons.\\n\\nAnd again this is where you'll start to see reasons why you don't see every single one of these optimizations in any single electric car out but you'll see a lot of some of this stuff. So first of all the roof is solid because there's solar panels over me so it feels a little bit less like a like a glass ceiling in so many of the cars with sunroofs. Also because of that slope shape smaller back seats not the biggest back seats in the world and very very low headroom area behind me. So I'd rather be in the front seat to put it lightly. But just looking around now we're thinking about ways to make as little energy as possible come from the actual driving experience of this car. So they have this huge horizontal display across the entire middle. And number one it is a micro LED display so in areas where it is pitch black it will be saving a little bit of energy just tiny little bits of things like that. And I think that's uh that's mostly where I see solar on a car being the most useful. If you have a hundred kilowatt hour battery and you leave the car outside all day getting all be generous 500 watts of power all day that's that's going to give you a couple of miles and a couple percent points back which is ideal but the second you can day like this well then you're going to have to plug it in anyway and this car can still plug in of course. But the things that are efficient and interesting about this car is there are still weight savings everywhere.\\n\\nThese these are these are thin carpets, also made of recyclable materials. These door handles out here are little pull tabs instead of extra material for the door handles. There's a lot of carbon fiber under the hood and the shell of this car is really lightweight materials. I still think they could have gone a little bit extra because let's be honest when you look at an interior you want comfort and luxury. So you do want big cushy soft leather and heated seats and heated steering wheel and things that all add weight and take extra power but it's going to depend on the type of car. If you're looking at an EQS they're going to go ahead and give you those comfort features where if you're looking at a sports car maybe they can save a little weight not do so much of that stuff. But look at these designs there's so many of these like hole cutouts like if this was solid it would be more weight wouldn't it. But now it's a 3D printed almost pseudo plastic so it's got a lot less weight in here because of the air conditioning vents which are working right now but I imagine those are pretty lightweight a lot of weight savings over here that my pull tab also very visually interesting.\\n\\nThe Mercedes engineers have been very kind enough to like share a lot of the interesting numbers and the development process behind the scenes with me and it's really cool stuff and that's how I know about the things like that this car's rear wheel drive for efficiency and that it has 100 kWh battery and is electronically limited to 140 kilometers an hour again just to slip through the air and be as efficient as possible. I'm gonna see if maybe they let me drive it maybe I might ask them about that. But even on the screen they're just they're just going right to efficiency talking about okay if you want to open or close the shutter in the front of the car that'll change the aerodynamic properties. If you want to open or close a diffuser you can do that on the screen too. And really the whole philosophy behind all this software in this car as you're driving is basically the gamification of efficiency of efficient driving. Because first of all the actual graphics on the display are powered by a game engine. They are showing all the things that it's measuring basically in real time just like your speedometer all the efficiency and all the energy usage is shown in real time and then it'll show it'll display the best route for ideal driving to maximize how much range you're going to get when you arrive. It'll show you exactly how to accelerate and what speed to go up and down certain hills.\\n\\nYou don't want to accelerate too fast because then the graphics will turn red and say slow down a little bit with some regen it'll turn back to blue again soon all this for you. It even shows real time wind speed on the screen in the car and that's thanks to special sensors there's a couple little punch outs on the outside of the car that are measuring air pressure and measuring the wind speed because that does determine how far you're able to go and how efficient you're being. So it's like everything in this car is designed to basically let you hyper mile every time you drive. Again it's not what you'd see in most cars most cars are finding a balancing act between being sporty or being comfortable or being luxurious or somewhere in that then diagram and this one is just full on efficiency turn a knob all the way up on all those things. So let's be open this door handle here. The number we've ended up with that this car was able to achieve is 745 miles on a single charge without stopping. That's the shape that's the efficiency maximum that's what we're able to do with today's technology with the knobs turned all the way up with the best technology we've got. Now you can see if you were designing a car like this for yourself you might have different thoughts about certain parts of this that you would take maybe if you have an ideal car in mind where you take some of the aerocap wheels and maybe that's more efficiency maybe you take this smaller mirrors on the side.\\n\\nMaybe you'd even take the sticker right here save a little bit of weight save a little bit of arrow and you get closer and closer and closer to that maximum number you probably don't end up going with this for a street car but the fact that this is done all of those things is really eye-opening to see where we're at with electric cars right now. So super cool let's see it.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/The_World_Record_Most_Efficient_Electric_Car_.txt'}),\n",

       " (Document(page_content=\"All right, today was a fun day because I got to spend some time with two of Lotus' new electric cars. Yeah, that Lotus, the one that's known for making ultra light sports cars and things like that, the ones that made the chassis for the original Tesla Roadster, it's kind of the antithesis of what we know Lotus to be, Lotus is typically making the lightest weight stuff, but this is, it just shows how obvious the electrification of the future of cars is. They're going right to Electric, not even Hybrids. So there's two out, there's an SUV that's been out on the road for a couple months now, and then there's a car, a sedan that is brand new, just got revealed. So they both look really sick, and the names are both really tough, but the sedan is called the Emea, EME YA. I got to sit in it, look around it, take a first look, that's the Super Sporty one, but then the SUV I got to drive. It's a little bit taller, but that's called the Electra, and that's one that's the more like wider appeal version. So this is it, the Emea, and it's honestly, it looks sick. Matter of fact, the three biggest things that I noticed, just around the outside of this car are one, it's a really good looking car, two, there's a lot of tech, but also a lot of analog, and then three, it just seems like there's a lot of moving parts, like a lot of moving parts, maybe some unnecessary, you'll see what I mean.\\n\\nSo yeah, first of all, clearly a good looking sedan, this thing, I don't think it has a bad angle, it's got like all these nice shapes and proportions all the way around. The driver sits pretty far forward, so kind of similar to a mid-engine car. The headlights are dope, it's got this twin daytime running light happening with these nice animations right above the actual headlights, I believe they're LED matrix headlights, and then across the back, there's a huge bar all the way across that actually doubles as a charge progress indicator. That shows real progress when the car is plugged in, so that's cool. There's carbon fiber everywhere from the rear splitter at the bottom of the side skirts to the front splitter. We'll get to the interior in a second, but there's carbon fiber there too. And then there's these huge sporty wheels, these are 22 inch lightweight performance wheels, wrapped in what looks like Michelin Pilot Sport EV LTS, which I've never heard of this tire before, but it's got all kinds of pilot sport 4S vibes, probably with some like lower rolling resistance optimizations, but these are some massive 305 millimeter wide tires on the back, and you can clearly see the high performance carbon ceramic brakes at all four corners too. This thing is non-messing around. Now, when I say that there's a lot of moving parts in this car, stick with me here. It gets kind of crazy, so first of all, the door handles is pretty normal.\\n\\nThey sit flush with the car until you get up to it with the key and then they pop open. We've seen that before, but that's a moving part. Then the power trunk lift gate is also very common, but that's another moving part. Good to see that there's a lot of space in here, and even a little room for some charging accessories, and a little sub-tronk area. But then the charge port cover is motorized instead of just a normal door. A little extra, but I guess it's nice to see in a car of this premium price. Then the car has lighter sensors all the way around for self-driving tech, but those cause a lot of drag when they're sticking out all the time. So just like the door handles, the ones on the front right, front left, and the top will also retract into the top and the sides of the car when they're not in use, which is again another moving part. Then there's an active rear wing, actually a sort of a pair of rear wings you can see in there that creates downforce, keeps the car planted at higher speeds, and that along with some moving parts below the car at the front and the back are going to be really good for stability. But then even the front of the car, even the grill up here, has a bunch of these smoothly moving parts to open and close the front, so it can be closed for less drag and better efficiency, or open for high performance driving to let more air through to cool the brakes and the batteries. And then the cherry on top is the power opening doors.\\n\\nSo all four doors you can open from either the display in the car or from an app, or just by pulling the door handle a little bit, and they will sense how much room they have and just motorized open as much as they can. And of course they can close with a button press as well, or just by putting your foot on the brake, but hey, now we're in this interior. Alright, so first of all, ignoring the fact that this is a right-hand drive car, because this is one of one Lotus prototype, and that's how they start things off, there's a ton of tech all around this car just absolutely loaded, and so I just want to show you guys some of the highlights, most of which I really like, some of which I have some questions about. So first of all, let's start with the screens. There's an OLED screen back behind the steering wheel here, shows your speed and range and stuff. There's a nice, pretty thin bezel OLED in the center, which is really responsive. It's running Unreal Engine, I am told, and that's a twin model of the car right there with all the controls, which I'll get to in a second. And then there's another screen over there on the left, passenger screen, right. Then there's an HUD behind the steering wheel, which is apparently a 55-inch equivalent field of view. I don't know exactly how to measure that, but it looks pretty crisp from where I'm sitting.\\n\\nThen there is a Qi wireless charger in here, there is your HVAC controls, which is just physical buttons, and then a bunch of LED lights that respond to the physical button presses, which is kind of neat. But then there's always a cloud and fiber trim, an actual gear selector here, but also physical park and hazards. Then this cool cup holder design, so if you want cup holders, you got them, but if you don't, you get rid of them, neat. And then there's some surge in the center, and I'll get to the back seat later. Above my head is an electrochromatic roof that is fully tinted right now and fully adjustable. Not on this prototype, but on the screen you'll be able to do that. That's super cool. There are a ton, a ton of speakers all around this cabin, from the side to the front to the doors, I mean, they're everywhere. By K-E-F, I believe is the brand name, here they are. K-E-F. I've never heard K-E-F speakers, and I want to hear these, but there's a ton of them, so I have high hopes. There's another one up at the front there. But some stuff that I'm kind of curious about, one, you see in a lot of these prototypes, instead of having mirrors, it's got cameras, and it's got these blind spot monitoring cameras right where you would look to see the mirrors. And they work super, super well, and they're actually legal in a lot of places, but not here yet.\\n\\nSo I believe that basically they'll have a trim piece, maybe some metal here, and an actual mirror in the car in the US, at least until that regulation changes. And then the other thing that I'm kind of curious about here is a steering wheel, really nice racing type steering wheel, Alcantara little center notch up here, and then there's some paddle shifters, and when I looked at these, I was like, oh, this is nice, these are metal, and the left side is regen up and down, so you can change the amount of regenerative braking, now on the right side, drive mode selector up and down. That's pretty fire. Voice controls as well, regular stocks for headlights and blinkers. But okay, here's a part that I'm a little bit mixed about. I'm kind of torn because this here is sweet. This is the smoothest UI. I've so far really ever seen in any car for all your controls, but you can change your driving modes here from track to sport to individual. As I do that, you get a whole bunch of settings changing. The suspension height is changing. Even the seat, it changes the amount that it's hugging me. So I'm in sport right now. I'm going to hit that track button, let's see if you can see it. He can't really see it, but it started hugging me more, like both stirring me more, into the seat. That is super cool. But then this is the HVAC controls. So we've seen this before. You've got your actual vents here for the HVAC. They're all around the car like normal.\\n\\nBut if you want to change the direction at the air flows, it's on the touchscreen again. So it's kind of this weird mix of, oh, I can change my temperature at any time, really easily here. Changes the red to go up, blue to go down, love that. But then if I want to turn off event, it's a touchscreen thing. So not in love with that, but that's the way they've decided to do it here. And then a whole bunch of other controls here for just car stuff in general. You can change all the ambient lighting colors. There's LEDs all over the cabin. It's red now. Now it's blue. Now it's pink. You can do whatever you want here in the entire cabin response. All your vehicle controls up here and opening and closing the trunk. And even changing the arrow. So on the back of the car, if you want to just put up the rear spoilers because you like the way they look, you can do that. I am super into how responsive this is. I have a feeling it's going to be much better for the final customer because they'll actually be able to connect to the internet and do navigation and things like that. But generally, good to see it. So I'm in the back seat now. Couple things again that I notice. Really nice build quality. Still speakers everywhere. Pretty good amount of headroom. I'm also behind the six three driving position. And there's a good amount of near room here. But the floor is really high. And there's not much space underneath the seat here. So I do feel like I can't extend my legs very much.\\n\\nI'd be comfortable here for a little bit, but not any type of long road trip. Again, it's a driver's car. I'm not shocked by that. But that's something I've noticed. But then ton of carbon fiber here. This huge electromagnetic roof all the way behind my head. These seats are really nice, lots of materials. And they're kind of bucket-y, not full bucket. But they're kind of bucket-y in a sporty way, which I like. Then they've got this screen here with controls. So this is the two seat rear option. They will have a three seat version. But as of right now, if you pick the two seat sort of executive seat option, this whole center column is taken up here. There's even more speakers in here. More fancy cup holders and LED lights and ventilation. And controls for the ventilation is by this touch screen. Here's another moving part for you. Hit that button right there. And this sort of elevates. Again, carbon fiber trim, really high quality. But it's another moving part. Then you've got this nice super smooth storage. I mean, that might be the smoothest center storage I've ever seen. It's totally silent. And then look behind me. There's like a water bottle holder. Maybe one or two water bottles in there. It stays open. Spring load shut. Super cool. This is a nice rear seat, especially for a car. That again is 900 plus horsepower, super sporty, bucket seats, driver focused, racing features. But not an entirely terrible back seat. Respectable. But honestly, who cares about the back seat?\\n\\nThis is a driver focused car, after all. That's why it has dual motors and 900 plus horsepower. That's why it does zero to 60 in under three seconds. That's why it has carbon ceramic brakes and custom tires and active arrow and active air suspension. In addition to the real pass through vents at the front, underneath the headlights, and at the back. Like if I had the car wow stick of truth here, you would see that these vents are very real. All of this is part of Lotus's DNA of making drivers cars. So, you know, to fill that for myself, it was time to switch to actually driving around an electric Lotus. This time, the SUV, the slightly higher off the ground, Lotus Electra. So, first thing I actually notice is there are one, two, three, four levels of regen. Off, one, two, or three. And all the way up on three in torque mode, it's in like one pedal driving. It's basically you can let off the accelerator and this thing will come all the way down slowly to a stop. But when I'm in sport mode, I realize the regen is not as strong. You can't really one pedal drive in sport mode. The maximum regen you get is not as strong, which is interesting. It reminds me kind of of somewhere in between the Taycan because of the handling and the EV6 GT for its impressive acceleration and just fun driving characteristics, just by being high off the ground. But thing about driving an electric car is you can never really say it feels light. It doesn't feel light. Sorry, Lotus, it doesn't feel light.\\n\\nSorry, Lotus fans. This is going to be the first Lotus somebody drives when they're like, well, it can't really hide how happy it is. But the suspension, I think what you really find is it's stronger and more technically impressive in the way it handles how much weight is being thrown at it. So it's still a good suspension. It's still good steering. It's just not the same as a really lightweight car would feel. I actually kind of wish that the screen in front of the steering wheel was bigger. Most tax kilometers and like dashboard screens behind the steering wheel are bigger than this. Here's a suspension that just apparently a thousand times per second. And very quickly too, like it can change ride heights from the lowest to the highest and back to the lowest in like a second or two. So that's pretty cool. The steering you can go from sport to tour. You can change active rear spoiler to be sporty. But I always leave it in sport power. Why ever turn the power down? So okay, I have listened to the speakers now. And they're really good. Really, really loud. There's also a ton of them like there are, I think several subwoofers. I don't know the exact layout, but there's a Dolby Atmos set up. There are speakers in this middle console here. Speakers around me. Speakers above me. Speakers behind me. When the bass is all the way up, I can see the mirror rattling. Like it's, it's allowed very, very solid speaker system.\\n\\nBut I think that's what people when they pay for they want to hear. This is good. It's also got special idea of sport. It sounds really good. And of course, the main thing that's kind of like an X variable with these is the range. It's basically going to look somewhere between 260 miles to like 300 miles, depending on your wheel size. So this has got to be huge 23 inch wheels on it. And it's showing me with a full battery and touring load like 275 miles of range. If you put it in sport mode, you won't get as much. But if you had 20 inch wheels, you could get even more. So you're looking at, yeah, up to probably 300 miles of range. Lotus right now is not yet on the list of car companies who have signed up to use Tesla's NACS sport. And so this one as of right now behind yet another moving part is CCS sport. And we'll do 350 kilowatt charging. And that will get it from like 10 to 80 percent, like 15 minutes or something crazy. It's very fast. There's 100 kilowatt hour battery. Very fast charging. But I do wonder if you want to get something like this. If you're going to road trip, you probably do want to hear that it will support NACS as of right now. But the one thing I did here will support at some point ideally with a software update. I don't know if these have gotten software updates yet, but they say that they will add Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. I believe that is also wireless. So your phone can sit on the wireless charger here.\\n\\nAnd you'll have those two things available to you as of right now. This shipping card doesn't have that. And the ones that I played with don't have that. Fingers crossed. Fingers on the steering wheel though. This is a nice steering wheel. Wow, wow. You know what else is crazy? You can actually feel when it shifts gears. So there are two years. This is similar to the Taycan again. It's dual motors, front motor and rear motor. And the rear motor has two speeds. And when you see what speed it happens, you actually feel the shift between first gear and second gear. Let me get a little bit of room. Okay, it's like it's a little over the speed limit that it happens. But you can feel that difference, that little shift. I don't know if it's intentional that they added that shift, but you can feel the shift. All right, one track mode full acceleration. Wow, wow. Yeah, it's got it. It's got it. It's got it. Man, if you really want an electric SUV, if that's specifically what you're in the market for, as of right now, there's not a ton of options. But of your options, I mean, you have Ionic 5, you have EV6, you have a lot of 50 to 70,000 dollar options. And then you kind of get up to like Tesla Model X plaid, Rivian R1S and this. And of those, this is the most fun to drive. This is more fun to drive than the Tesla. The Model X does accelerate harder. No doubt about it. I am ruined by the plaid, triple motor powertrain acceleration.\\n\\nBut that thing is nowhere near as stable, nowhere near as comfortable driving, nowhere near as good handling as this. And this is definitely more fun to drive. So if you're going to spend more, I love the R1S. That's my favorite in this segment of what they do. But this is the most fun to drive. And that's what it's made for. I'm impressed. I have my doubts, obviously, about a lot of the moving parts being a little bit unnecessary and a lot of the extra things that this car does, that it doesn't have to do. But that's kind of the point of getting into cars up in this price, this 80 to 100 plus thousand dollar car, when it's a Lotus, when it's a sports vehicle, you want it to feel special. And this does a lot of that. And it just kind of speaks for the whole electrification of everything that every car company is doing across the board. It doesn't matter who, doesn't matter if it's Lotus, the company who you thought would never make a heavy car ever, everyone's doing it. And it's just a matter of how they do it. And I think they've done this pretty well for their first try. I'm not going to lie. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/Lotus_Eletre_and_Emeya_First_Look_and_Drive_.txt'}),\n",

       " (Document(page_content=\"Alright, I'm officially adding BMW to my list of car companies that are doing a pretty good job of electrifying their lineups. BMW's had their i3 of course for a while. i8, their hybrids been around, but now the i4, the i7, and this is the iX. They're crossover SUV. It's biggest sin is just being ugly. I promise, that's the worst thing about this car. It is expensive too, with $85,000, so that's where you start to get into the luxury price range and you really start to think about what exactly am I paying for here? But as far as fundamentals, oh wow, there's a lot of angles of this that look not amazing, but you know, my grow on you, but they've got the fundamentals, they've got a lot of space, they've got luxury, they've got features. Let's look inside. Well actually let's walk around the outside real quick because I want to point out some things. I'm going to try not to call it ugly at every turn. I promise. Okay, let's just get into the fundamentals here. So right up at the front, you've got BMW logo, a little bit of fake arrow, a little inlet, whatever we're going on here, but that's a grill. I mean a fake grill. It's just plastic, but it's got this sort of a chrome bronze action going on around both the inside and outside of the car that we'll see a bit more. Obviously these EVs are supposed to be aerodynamic. I'll say this is not one of those EVs that's designed from the ground up to be fully electric. There is no huge front trunk.\\n\\nThere is no like cavernous extra space in here, but they have done a good job tailoring some of the stuff. So here's the EV wheels. I don't think they're pretty. That's when way of saying it. You again have this trim all the way along the side here. These door handles are kind of nice. You kind of pop your hand in there. We'll go in in a second. There's the back. This is the charge port. Fundamentals are pretty good. It's got both AC and DC fast charging. I think it's a little over 200 kilowatts, which is pretty decent. And this X drive 50 will go about 300 full miles on a charge. And that's pretty accurate. It is surprisingly efficient to go 300 miles on the size of battery that this is. Huge BMW logo on the back. Big slot lights here. These are like a little bit indented a little, but very bright, very large, pretty distinctive look from the back. I don't mind it. And then again, you get this trim around here, this bronze. And then you've got that shape of an SUV with a lot of space and the hatchback look. I'm going to open this back trunk to see if you can see the way this opens. It kind of reminds me of the lucid here. So you get your little opener right there. It's automatic power opening. And this is a big, slanted opening like a clamshell type action here. And then you've got your space. Now again, not a ton of space, but here's your sub trunk. That's useful for things not sliding around. And then this is a pretty decent amount of space, not as much as I would expect.\\n\\nThe useful. Good trunk. After a port there is also power folding seats, so you can put the seats down here really easily. And there is a light in the trunk. So that's cool for the price being able to put almost a full on bicycle in there. That's pretty nice. But generally for $85,000, you know, that's the type of thing you're expecting. It's also a BMW. So they've got a bunch of other vehicles to compare this to again. Fundamentals are fine. It's just really only one sin. There's really only one sin here. Look, the aesthetic for me was like, okay, at first I looked at it and I was like, okay, yeah, that's ugly. Now slowly it started to grow on me. Like I've had it for a week. I've been driving it. I do appreciate the lights really. Honestly, they are very bright. It's got these LED lights in here. And so I appreciate that it's bright and visible on the road and all of that is nice. So it was slowly starting to grow on me a little bit. It's still. I don't know. There's going to be some people like guarantee in the comments who are like, that is sleek. It's hot. That looks good. I just see nostrils or teeth maybe. But luckily you don't have to look at the outside of your own car very often. You spend most of your time actually inside it. So let's look inside. Again, it's got this bronze trim. You get inside like that. And one weird observation is I don't like the sound of closing a door. So I'll let you hear it. Doesn't it kind of sound like a bit of a rattle there? It's weird.\\n\\nAnyway, there's a strip light here, LEDs. And then you get into the cockpit of I X X drive 50. And there is a lot going on. Oh my god. Music. So this is a pretty comfortable interior. I must say except for one weird choice. So basically it's got this really large during wheel with a semi interesting shape. But the leather is really soft. The stitching is nice. You've got this leather material over here, fabric here, leather fabric, not as much plastic as the previous vehicle. You can see a lot of glass. And then there's a little bit more interesting material choices. Visually cool. Functionally, I'll get there. But again, you know, I'm still sticking into the camp of not the prettiest thing in the world, but quite comfortable. This has armrests. Obviously this is a, this is a heated string wheel. But also when we turn that on, this armrest heats up and this armrest heats up. So you kind of just sit back and everything around you. The seat is heated. That's just a nice comfortable interior. But the one thing is this, this little plastic insert here with a shorter passenger, I mean, 5, 8 and under. That's just like the back of your head. It's kind of a weird spot. I mean, the rest of it is nice. It's heated. It's leather. It's soft. I just thought that was kind of odd. But generally, you know, I haven't driven a ton of other BMWs, but I do like this sort of a floating display look they've got going on here with the displays in the middle.\\n\\nOne display behind the steering wheel, the other display over to the right, both very visible. This line sort of by-sex to two, which is, it's well thought out and it looks good. And then from there, the software decently intuitive. Now, control-wise, we've talked about this in some other cars before. I don't know about this whole crystal thing. Like some people are going to again think it's really neat. And sometimes even reflects like some lights around the rest of the cabin when like the sunlight shines on it. I might say it's a little bit tacky. It does work functionally. It's fine. It gets your seats in the right place. Great. That's your unlock. That's your door open, unlock and lock. But this here is much prettier than it is functional. So you've got these buttons that you can see here. This home, this is a knob looking to left right up down and it is your way of controlling and scrolling on the screen here. But it is also a touch screen. And this volume knob it works, but then also these buttons being haptic are particularly slow. Like this haptic response is supposed to give it the feeling of a button. But I don't like how slow it is to respond. And it really doesn't feel like a button. So every time you want to press any of those buttons, you got to look down. You got to make sure you hit the right button. Just a little bit quirky. A little, maybe a little too quirky from BMW. Maybe real buttons with the fine surface areas would have been cool here.\\n\\nBecause these are useful buttons. You get your parking cameras, which you do get a full 360 view and it top down. You have your driving modes, which is both sport or efficient or your own personal, which lets you jump in and of course change all the settings. Of course, I have to actually be on to do that. There's an on button in this EV, which is they all kind of are starting to do that, which is annoying, but that's fine. But then this ends up being a lot of your other controls. And then HVAC controls are only two real buttons and then the rest are all on the touch screen. We've talked about this. We've talked about this. Obviously having real event controls is nice and fan opening clothes is nice. But everything else here, again, it's comfortable having the different levels of heat from the steering wheel and from the armrests and all that. Cool, but not ideal while driving to have to do a lot on the touch screen. Now before I forget, let me show you a couple of other things. First of all, most other cars, when I open the door, they turn the music volume down. This one doesn't, which I thought that was kind of weird, that that was missing. But let's jump in the back seat real quick so I can show you behind a 6-3-draving position. I feel like your feet are kind of high off the ground, but there is a good amount of space and boom, two USB-C ports and whatever you want to put in there. So that's good for charging phones. That's on both sides.\\n\\nYou also get all these controls here and of course your feet are going to be heated. The ventilation in the back is good to see lots of high quality leather. So this is a good passenger experience. Also with this gigantic sunroof overhead, it doesn't open and closed, but still cool to see. I do feel a little bit lower than I expected, but that's fine. Also, don't want to forget that. In here, there is a cup holder in the armrest. No fancy wireless charger or tablet or anything, but you have that option. And of course, your lights up here. What do people put in these folders? Manila envelopes? Okay, anyway, back to the front. Let's talk a little bit more about actually owning and driving the IX50. So you may, weird sound. You may or may not already know about the M60 version, which is a little bit less range, like 270 miles, but a little bit more power. So up to 600 horsepower instead of 500. But this is plenty fast in a straight line. It's good for a four seconds or at a 60. I think it traps 112 and a quarter mile, which is electronically limited top speed. But it has a surprising amount of get up and go in a straight line. But that's not really what it's about. It's much more of that luxury drive, which is what you'd expect from the big SUV with the big battery pack and the heated armrests are all, they're already warming up for me now, which is cool. So that's kind of how I feel about most of the way this drives. A couple of the notes though, it does have rear wheel steer.\\n\\nAnd I didn't even know that before I got in and I started driving and I was turning around on a tight parking spot and you notice when that tight turning radius is like super clean, you can get to any spot. Love that. So it has the rear wheel steer and it just has this very light steering. So the whole thing is very maneuverable and easy. Doesn't feel particularly sporty and that's fine. And then they also actually kind of do a couple. Oh look, there's the light from the crystal hitting my leg here. It's just a fun, weird thing that happens when you've got crystals in a car. It does make a couple choices that are sort of mimicking regular gas powered cars more. One of them is that yes, there is region braking when you take your foot off the brake pedal or the accelerator, take your foot off, it starts to slow down. But the region doesn't go all the way to zero miles an hour. It'll go to like six miles an hour and then you're coasting. So you still have to hit the brake pedal to get to zero. I wish there was a one pedal drive setting. I haven't been able to find it. Maybe I'm not looking hard enough, but that's something they've chosen. And also a little bit of a latency between when I hit the pedal and the acceleration actually starts. This I thought was a little odd smack in the pedal just flooring it. There's actually a tiny delay before it starts sending you forward.\\n\\nSomething that feels like almost the same amount of lag is you know a kick down in an engine shifting gears to hit the right RPM. It's kind of weird. Then it gets up and goes, which is fine. But it's very approachable if you've driven a lot of gas cars before. And then it does have wireless Android auto, which I use and CarPlay, which is great because that means you can put your phone kind of anywhere. It does have this clever spot right here, which kind of seems weird, but there is a pass through here to some plugs USB-C down here. So if you do so, want to keep your phone up here, even while wireless car playing or Android auto, you can route up a cable, which I thought that was pretty clever. But this is also a wireless charger, which is cool to see. It is in a kind of an awkward place to fumble and put your phone, but hey, you can do that if you want to. I just like that that wireless transmits thumbs up there. This speaker is in this car, which are by Harmon Carden, are very solid and get very loud. You can do volume control on the steering wheel here or by this little knob. It's a little base heavy and light untroubled by default, but there's an EQ setting and you can go crazy with it and it sounds really good after that. Oh, I also wanted to mention there are gesture controls. Let me know if you think this is gimmicky.\\n\\nI kind of have my feeling already, but you can see I'm playing a song and I do that and it goes to the next song and do that and it goes to the previous song or the beginning of that song. But here's another one here. You just do this and volume can turn up and down. I mean, it's clearly gimmicky. You have this next song and previous song and volume control here on the steering wheel. You also have this laggy next song and previous song and volume controls here. So I wouldn't really worry about this too much, even though it is maybe something that they could pump this, I think is it maybe this camera right here. I'm not actually sure which camera is looking for those gesture controls, but actually it's probably this one. It's probably the one right above me. Yeah, it kind of works, but it's a gimmick. But honestly, you know, I've gone through a lot of things about this car. The range is solid. The space is solid. The fundamentals are solid. It's comfortable generally and less or too short in the passenger seat. There's a lot going for it. I think my biggest complaint is I don't think it looks great. So I mean, there are other competitors in this area. You look at the price tag, 80 to 90 thousand dollars and you could easily go get Tesla Model X. You could easily go get Rivian R1S. You could get a Genesis GB60. There's a bunch of other stuff that all hit different strengths in different ways.\\n\\nSo let's say you could get this one if you're a fan of BMW, you're a fan of comfort, light steering, relaxed ride, surprising amount of straight line power and 300 miles of range is good enough for you, which there are others that do the same stuff, but some people are just not heard BMW people and they like this. So yeah, that's it for my thoughts on the IX. Thanks for watching. Let me know what you think. Catch you in the next one.

       " (Document(page_content=\"Alright, what's up y'all? I'm back with another hybrid. It's one of the weirdest hybrids I've ever tested in implementation. So when you think of hybrid, you probably think of the hybrids that are trying to get the best gas mileage possible. This is not one of those hybrids. This is one of those hybrids that's geared for improving performance. I talked about it in the Ferrari 296 review. There are hybrids coming out. Lots of sports car hybrids on the horizon that mix electric and gas, the best of both worlds, to give you the best possible performance. And this is one of them. So this is the Corvette E-Ray brand new shiny blue paint color too. A whole bunch of cool things about this car I want to show you, but also just these weird quirks. And don't get me wrong, living with it is great. I've been living with it for a couple days now and it's awesome, but it just has this weird implementation of the hybrid system that I want to show you. So all the things that we know and love about this new C8 platform are still true. Like there's a bunch of other variants of the C8 Corvette. This still has all that awesomeness. It's got the engine from the stingray behind the driver. It's mid engine. It's got the wide body shape of the Z06. I reviewed the Z06 already. If you want to learn a whole bunch more about this car and I really enjoyed that thing, that one much more track focus, much more hardcore. It's just the naturally aspirated V8.\\n\\nThis one because it's electrified, it's aiming to be the most livable Corvette ever. And I think it succeeds with being the best dailyable Corvette they've ever made. So, you know, E-Ray stuff is going to be this new body color bumper, which I think with the blue paint looks really, really good, not going to lie. Still got that front trunk up there we all love. And then back here, you still got these huge vents. I want to go to the back. I mean the only way you can really tell it's E-Ray is because of this badging down here. It says E-Ray. It's got that stingray badge up top here. And this is how the back of the E-Ray looks. And then you're also going to have this wishbone shape here on the side of the car. If it is painted body color, that's how you know you're looking at an E-Ray on the street unless the owner's modified it. But also I think that's such a good looking silhouette. It's clear they were inspired by Ferrari. I mean you get a lot of Ferrari vibes with this silhouette. But the first hint at what they're trying to do with this car is over here at the tires. You get staggered wheels, 21 inch in the back, 20 inch in the front, carbon ceramic brakes, but they are on Michelin all season tires. I feel like all season tires. That's the biggest statement you can make shipping a car from the factory with all season tires, which is hey we want you to drive this thing all year round. This is the Northeast. It's barely over 50 degrees today.\\n\\nIt's going to get down to the 30s and you can drive this car in the winter. But then you already know about the practicality of this platform, this mid-engine with the front trunk but also the rear trunk. So if you open this whole back section there you go. You can fit if you've got a normal size golf bag. You can fit a whole golf bag back here and there's the engine from the Stingray that 6.2 liter I believe. So this V8 is putting out about 500 horsepower and then you get an electric motor at the front between the front wheels. That's kicking out another 160 horsepower. Totalling about 650 horsepower, which is sick, that makes it the first Corvette with all-wheel drive. It makes it the quickest Corvette ever by the 10.5 second quarter, 2.5 second zero to 60. And it still sounds pretty good if I sit in here and fire it up. You'll hear what I mean. This is one of the challenges of YouTube is trying to try to get the sound to go through on camera but doesn't even have a soft one. That's crazy. So the design is great. The power train is rock solid and the practicality is still here. All the things we like about this CA platform are still here but once you get into the specifics, the details of the hybrid system, that's when it starts to get weird. So they built this platform with the idea of making a hybrid version in mind.\\n\\nSo they left a room up front between the front two wheels to put the electric motor and right through the middle is a pretty small battery pack but it's completely separate from the rear axle. Completely separate. So that means the front axle and only the front axle is powered by the battery and the electric motor and the rear axle and only the rear axle is powered by the V8. So you still, it's technically all wheel drive but that's going to mean you don't get quite the same list of benefits and behaviors as a hybrid that say has electric on all both axles or an all wheel drive car from the gas engine by itself. So here's what I mean. So again the car and the driver seat here and get the best possible view. That square steering wheel, love it or hate it. So the battery pack is in here. You can start up the car as one of the primary benefits in what's called stealth mode. All you have to do is get in, close the door and buckle up. Yes, you have to. And then you'll get this nice animation on the screens that are actually telling you you can do this which is starting up the car in stealth mode. As you can imagine that's electric only. All you got to do is turn that knob to the right and it's going to say, oh you're looking to do a different mode than usual. Yeah, we got those. We have normal mode, shuttle mode and stealth mode. Stealth mode starts up the car just using the electrical power. You hit start and I'm going to put the window down so you can hear this.\\n\\nThe car is now fully electric and drives like an electric car with this sound. It is truly super cool to be able to drive around a car like this completely silently. As you can imagine the use cases, you fire it up in the morning, you leave your garage totally silently. You don't wake up your spouse or the neighbors and you leave the neighborhood silently. This can get three to four miles of electric on a full charge and it'll go up to about 45 miles an hour after which it will kick on the V8 behind you to fill in the extra torque that you've asked of it to go over 45 miles an hour and then it does this whole spinning up sinking process. Again, because the front and rear axles are not talking to each other, it's got to figure out how fast you're going, fire up the engine, sink everything, get the RPMs matched and then have everything turn on. It's it's really bizarre and it works but you can only do stealth mode from ignition. You cannot do stealth mode in the middle of a drive or as you're coming back into your neighborhood at the end of the day because again, it's separate. But then another subquirk, if I can trademark that Doug Numerra, a subquirk of this car is stealth mode is not available under 50 degrees Fahrenheit. I'll put the stealth mode on there. At all. Like I'll bring the car home, it'll be a cold day and I want to start in stealth mode the next morning and I'll try it and it'll say stealth mode not available.\\n\\nBut this is supposed to be a car that you can daily everywhere and it has all seasons implying in winter climates you can use it but stealth mode won't work under 50. Kind of weird. So let's already do the first quirk. You can't start stealth mode any time while you're driving. It has to be as you start the car. But the second interesting thing about this car is there's actually a button down here that lets you start recharging the tiny built-in battery at any point. So let's say you're out driving you've been using a bunch of battery. It's doing all the awesome stuff that it does. Performance-wise to fill in the torque gaps and make it a super fun drive pulls you out of corners from that front axle off the line. It's awesome. It does all that. Now you have a lower battery but you know you want to leave in stealth mode the next morning. You hit this button it's called charge plus and it'll opportunistically fill the battery back to 100% as quickly as possible. I think this is a great feature and it's shocking how fast it charges the battery back up. Like if you were to guess let's say you're at roughly 75 or 80% which is where it likes to keep the battery. How long do you think it would take to charge as you're driving neighborhood speeds back up to 100% battery? Three minutes, two minutes, it's like 15 seconds.\\n\\nYou can watch it on the screen fill up 1% at a time as you're driving because it's such a small battery and it charges so quickly that you can really quickly get up to 100% battery. So that's interesting. It's such a small battery but then like I said you can get it up to 100% and it will like to stay around 80% if you're not doing charge plus. So yeah all this stuff these quirks are really interesting and I call them quirks because they're not quite advantages but the fact that you can't use stealth mode as you're driving you have to start it from a park. That's a quirk right the fact that you don't get all of the traction control benefits of an electric motor because it's not on the rear axle at all. Most of the power is still doing the normal V8 stuff from the rear axle. You do get some benefits and as you drive this thing you notice them. You really notice it pulling you forward a little more responsibly and all sorts of scenarios where you would be waiting for the V8 to spool up. All that is great but yeah it's definitely it's got those quirks. So you put it all together and what do you get? You get the e-ray which I don't even know if it will be the most popular Corvette in this C8 lineup but I do think if you look at every single one in the lineup as far as which one people decide to daily drive every single day it should be this one. This is the one that makes the most sense in the winter. It's got the off-season tires.\\n\\nIt's got all-wheel drive and it is still super quick and still sounds really really good. I do expect a couple more versions of this this platform to come out with maybe even more power but until then this is the most friendly most daily drivable and in my opinion the most livable Corvette ever made thanks to going kind of electric. So let me know if you had to pick one of the C8 Corvettes to live with as your daily driver despite the possible downsides would you pick this one? I still think I would. Let me know though thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/The_Strangest_Electrified_Sports_Car_Yet_.txt'}),\n",

       "[Document(page_content=\"All right, today was a fun day because I got to spend some time with two of Lotus' new electric cars. Yeah, that Lotus, the one that's known for making ultra light sports cars and things like that, the ones that made the chassis for the original Tesla Roadster, it's kind of the antithesis of what we know Lotus to be, Lotus is typically making the lightest weight stuff, but this is, it just shows how obvious the electrification of the future of cars is. They're going right to Electric, not even Hybrids. So there's two out, there's an SUV that's been out on the road for a couple months now, and then there's a car, a sedan that is brand new, just got revealed. So they both look really sick, and the names are both really tough, but the sedan is called the Emea, EME YA. I got to sit in it, look around it, take a first look, that's the Super Sporty one, but then the SUV I got to drive. It's a little bit taller, but that's called the Electra, and that's one that's the more like wider appeal version. So this is it, the Emea, and it's honestly, it looks sick. Matter of fact, the three biggest things that I noticed, just around the outside of this car are one, it's a really good looking car, two, there's a lot of tech, but also a lot of analog, and then three, it just seems like there's a lot of moving parts, like a lot of moving parts, maybe some unnecessary, you'll see what I mean.\\n\\nSo yeah, first of all, clearly a good looking sedan, this thing, I don't think it has a bad angle, it's got like all these nice shapes and proportions all the way around. The driver sits pretty far forward, so kind of similar to a mid-engine car. The headlights are dope, it's got this twin daytime running light happening with these nice animations right above the actual headlights, I believe they're LED matrix headlights, and then across the back, there's a huge bar all the way across that actually doubles as a charge progress indicator. That shows real progress when the car is plugged in, so that's cool. There's carbon fiber everywhere from the rear splitter at the bottom of the side skirts to the front splitter. We'll get to the interior in a second, but there's carbon fiber there too. And then there's these huge sporty wheels, these are 22 inch lightweight performance wheels, wrapped in what looks like Michelin Pilot Sport EV LTS, which I've never heard of this tire before, but it's got all kinds of pilot sport 4S vibes, probably with some like lower rolling resistance optimizations, but these are some massive 305 millimeter wide tires on the back, and you can clearly see the high performance carbon ceramic brakes at all four corners too. This thing is non-messing around. Now, when I say that there's a lot of moving parts in this car, stick with me here. It gets kind of crazy, so first of all, the door handles is pretty normal.\\n\\nThey sit flush with the car until you get up to it with the key and then they pop open. We've seen that before, but that's a moving part. Then the power trunk lift gate is also very common, but that's another moving part. Good to see that there's a lot of space in here, and even a little room for some charging accessories, and a little sub-tronk area. But then the charge port cover is motorized instead of just a normal door. A little extra, but I guess it's nice to see in a car of this premium price. Then the car has lighter sensors all the way around for self-driving tech, but those cause a lot of drag when they're sticking out all the time. So just like the door handles, the ones on the front right, front left, and the top will also retract into the top and the sides of the car when they're not in use, which is again another moving part. Then there's an active rear wing, actually a sort of a pair of rear wings you can see in there that creates downforce, keeps the car planted at higher speeds, and that along with some moving parts below the car at the front and the back are going to be really good for stability. But then even the front of the car, even the grill up here, has a bunch of these smoothly moving parts to open and close the front, so it can be closed for less drag and better efficiency, or open for high performance driving to let more air through to cool the brakes and the batteries. And then the cherry on top is the power opening doors.\\n\\nSo all four doors you can open from either the display in the car or from an app, or just by pulling the door handle a little bit, and they will sense how much room they have and just motorized open as much as they can. And of course they can close with a button press as well, or just by putting your foot on the brake, but hey, now we're in this interior. Alright, so first of all, ignoring the fact that this is a right-hand drive car, because this is one of one Lotus prototype, and that's how they start things off, there's a ton of tech all around this car just absolutely loaded, and so I just want to show you guys some of the highlights, most of which I really like, some of which I have some questions about. So first of all, let's start with the screens. There's an OLED screen back behind the steering wheel here, shows your speed and range and stuff. There's a nice, pretty thin bezel OLED in the center, which is really responsive. It's running Unreal Engine, I am told, and that's a twin model of the car right there with all the controls, which I'll get to in a second. And then there's another screen over there on the left, passenger screen, right. Then there's an HUD behind the steering wheel, which is apparently a 55-inch equivalent field of view. I don't know exactly how to measure that, but it looks pretty crisp from where I'm sitting.\\n\\nThen there is a Qi wireless charger in here, there is your HVAC controls, which is just physical buttons, and then a bunch of LED lights that respond to the physical button presses, which is kind of neat. But then there's always a cloud and fiber trim, an actual gear selector here, but also physical park and hazards. Then this cool cup holder design, so if you want cup holders, you got them, but if you don't, you get rid of them, neat. And then there's some surge in the center, and I'll get to the back seat later. Above my head is an electrochromatic roof that is fully tinted right now and fully adjustable. Not on this prototype, but on the screen you'll be able to do that. That's super cool. There are a ton, a ton of speakers all around this cabin, from the side to the front to the doors, I mean, they're everywhere. By K-E-F, I believe is the brand name, here they are. K-E-F. I've never heard K-E-F speakers, and I want to hear these, but there's a ton of them, so I have high hopes. There's another one up at the front there. But some stuff that I'm kind of curious about, one, you see in a lot of these prototypes, instead of having mirrors, it's got cameras, and it's got these blind spot monitoring cameras right where you would look to see the mirrors. And they work super, super well, and they're actually legal in a lot of places, but not here yet.\\n\\nSo I believe that basically they'll have a trim piece, maybe some metal here, and an actual mirror in the car in the US, at least until that regulation changes. And then the other thing that I'm kind of curious about here is a steering wheel, really nice racing type steering wheel, Alcantara little center notch up here, and then there's some paddle shifters, and when I looked at these, I was like, oh, this is nice, these are metal, and the left side is regen up and down, so you can change the amount of regenerative braking, now on the right side, drive mode selector up and down. That's pretty fire. Voice controls as well, regular stocks for headlights and blinkers. But okay, here's a part that I'm a little bit mixed about. I'm kind of torn because this here is sweet. This is the smoothest UI. I've so far really ever seen in any car for all your controls, but you can change your driving modes here from track to sport to individual. As I do that, you get a whole bunch of settings changing. The suspension height is changing. Even the seat, it changes the amount that it's hugging me. So I'm in sport right now. I'm going to hit that track button, let's see if you can see it. He can't really see it, but it started hugging me more, like both stirring me more, into the seat. That is super cool. But then this is the HVAC controls. So we've seen this before. You've got your actual vents here for the HVAC. They're all around the car like normal.\\n\\nBut if you want to change the direction at the air flows, it's on the touchscreen again. So it's kind of this weird mix of, oh, I can change my temperature at any time, really easily here. Changes the red to go up, blue to go down, love that. But then if I want to turn off event, it's a touchscreen thing. So not in love with that, but that's the way they've decided to do it here. And then a whole bunch of other controls here for just car stuff in general. You can change all the ambient lighting colors. There's LEDs all over the cabin. It's red now. Now it's blue. Now it's pink. You can do whatever you want here in the entire cabin response. All your vehicle controls up here and opening and closing the trunk. And even changing the arrow. So on the back of the car, if you want to just put up the rear spoilers because you like the way they look, you can do that. I am super into how responsive this is. I have a feeling it's going to be much better for the final customer because they'll actually be able to connect to the internet and do navigation and things like that. But generally, good to see it. So I'm in the back seat now. Couple things again that I notice. Really nice build quality. Still speakers everywhere. Pretty good amount of headroom. I'm also behind the six three driving position. And there's a good amount of near room here. But the floor is really high. And there's not much space underneath the seat here. So I do feel like I can't extend my legs very much.\\n\\nI'd be comfortable here for a little bit, but not any type of long road trip. Again, it's a driver's car. I'm not shocked by that. But that's something I've noticed. But then ton of carbon fiber here. This huge electromagnetic roof all the way behind my head. These seats are really nice, lots of materials. And they're kind of bucket-y, not full bucket. But they're kind of bucket-y in a sporty way, which I like. Then they've got this screen here with controls. So this is the two seat rear option. They will have a three seat version. But as of right now, if you pick the two seat sort of executive seat option, this whole center column is taken up here. There's even more speakers in here. More fancy cup holders and LED lights and ventilation. And controls for the ventilation is by this touch screen. Here's another moving part for you. Hit that button right there. And this sort of elevates. Again, carbon fiber trim, really high quality. But it's another moving part. Then you've got this nice super smooth storage. I mean, that might be the smoothest center storage I've ever seen. It's totally silent. And then look behind me. There's like a water bottle holder. Maybe one or two water bottles in there. It stays open. Spring load shut. Super cool. This is a nice rear seat, especially for a car. That again is 900 plus horsepower, super sporty, bucket seats, driver focused, racing features. But not an entirely terrible back seat. Respectable. But honestly, who cares about the back seat?\\n\\nThis is a driver focused car, after all. That's why it has dual motors and 900 plus horsepower. That's why it does zero to 60 in under three seconds. That's why it has carbon ceramic brakes and custom tires and active arrow and active air suspension. In addition to the real pass through vents at the front, underneath the headlights, and at the back. Like if I had the car wow stick of truth here, you would see that these vents are very real. All of this is part of Lotus's DNA of making drivers cars. So, you know, to fill that for myself, it was time to switch to actually driving around an electric Lotus. This time, the SUV, the slightly higher off the ground, Lotus Electra. So, first thing I actually notice is there are one, two, three, four levels of regen. Off, one, two, or three. And all the way up on three in torque mode, it's in like one pedal driving. It's basically you can let off the accelerator and this thing will come all the way down slowly to a stop. But when I'm in sport mode, I realize the regen is not as strong. You can't really one pedal drive in sport mode. The maximum regen you get is not as strong, which is interesting. It reminds me kind of of somewhere in between the Taycan because of the handling and the EV6 GT for its impressive acceleration and just fun driving characteristics, just by being high off the ground. But thing about driving an electric car is you can never really say it feels light. It doesn't feel light. Sorry, Lotus, it doesn't feel light.\\n\\nSorry, Lotus fans. This is going to be the first Lotus somebody drives when they're like, well, it can't really hide how happy it is. But the suspension, I think what you really find is it's stronger and more technically impressive in the way it handles how much weight is being thrown at it. So it's still a good suspension. It's still good steering. It's just not the same as a really lightweight car would feel. I actually kind of wish that the screen in front of the steering wheel was bigger. Most tax kilometers and like dashboard screens behind the steering wheel are bigger than this. Here's a suspension that just apparently a thousand times per second. And very quickly too, like it can change ride heights from the lowest to the highest and back to the lowest in like a second or two. So that's pretty cool. The steering you can go from sport to tour. You can change active rear spoiler to be sporty. But I always leave it in sport power. Why ever turn the power down? So okay, I have listened to the speakers now. And they're really good. Really, really loud. There's also a ton of them like there are, I think several subwoofers. I don't know the exact layout, but there's a Dolby Atmos set up. There are speakers in this middle console here. Speakers around me. Speakers above me. Speakers behind me. When the bass is all the way up, I can see the mirror rattling. Like it's, it's allowed very, very solid speaker system.\\n\\nBut I think that's what people when they pay for they want to hear. This is good. It's also got special idea of sport. It sounds really good. And of course, the main thing that's kind of like an X variable with these is the range. It's basically going to look somewhere between 260 miles to like 300 miles, depending on your wheel size. So this has got to be huge 23 inch wheels on it. And it's showing me with a full battery and touring load like 275 miles of range. If you put it in sport mode, you won't get as much. But if you had 20 inch wheels, you could get even more. So you're looking at, yeah, up to probably 300 miles of range. Lotus right now is not yet on the list of car companies who have signed up to use Tesla's NACS sport. And so this one as of right now behind yet another moving part is CCS sport. And we'll do 350 kilowatt charging. And that will get it from like 10 to 80 percent, like 15 minutes or something crazy. It's very fast. There's 100 kilowatt hour battery. Very fast charging. But I do wonder if you want to get something like this. If you're going to road trip, you probably do want to hear that it will support NACS as of right now. But the one thing I did here will support at some point ideally with a software update. I don't know if these have gotten software updates yet, but they say that they will add Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. I believe that is also wireless. So your phone can sit on the wireless charger here.\\n\\nAnd you'll have those two things available to you as of right now. This shipping card doesn't have that. And the ones that I played with don't have that. Fingers crossed. Fingers on the steering wheel though. This is a nice steering wheel. Wow, wow. You know what else is crazy? You can actually feel when it shifts gears. So there are two years. This is similar to the Taycan again. It's dual motors, front motor and rear motor. And the rear motor has two speeds. And when you see what speed it happens, you actually feel the shift between first gear and second gear. Let me get a little bit of room. Okay, it's like it's a little over the speed limit that it happens. But you can feel that difference, that little shift. I don't know if it's intentional that they added that shift, but you can feel the shift. All right, one track mode full acceleration. Wow, wow. Yeah, it's got it. It's got it. It's got it. Man, if you really want an electric SUV, if that's specifically what you're in the market for, as of right now, there's not a ton of options. But of your options, I mean, you have Ionic 5, you have EV6, you have a lot of 50 to 70,000 dollar options. And then you kind of get up to like Tesla Model X plaid, Rivian R1S and this. And of those, this is the most fun to drive. This is more fun to drive than the Tesla. The Model X does accelerate harder. No doubt about it. I am ruined by the plaid, triple motor powertrain acceleration.\\n\\nBut that thing is nowhere near as stable, nowhere near as comfortable driving, nowhere near as good handling as this. And this is definitely more fun to drive. So if you're going to spend more, I love the R1S. That's my favorite in this segment of what they do. But this is the most fun to drive. And that's what it's made for. I'm impressed. I have my doubts, obviously, about a lot of the moving parts being a little bit unnecessary and a lot of the extra things that this car does, that it doesn't have to do. But that's kind of the point of getting into cars up in this price, this 80 to 100 plus thousand dollar car, when it's a Lotus, when it's a sports vehicle, you want it to feel special. And this does a lot of that. And it just kind of speaks for the whole electrification of everything that every car company is doing across the board. It doesn't matter who, doesn't matter if it's Lotus, the company who you thought would never make a heavy car ever, everyone's doing it. And it's just a matter of how they do it. And I think they've done this pretty well for their first try. I'm not going to lie. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/Lotus_Eletre_and_Emeya_First_Look_and_Drive_.txt'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"It was up y'all, Marquez here, and I had a bit of extra time for something that I'm out here in LA for. So while this here, I decided to go stop by the Peterson Auto Museum. And what do you know? They have a Tesla exhibit here with a bunch of Tesla's vehicles set up, including the 2019 Cybertruck prototype. Essentially the one that was on stage when it was first revealed a couple years ago. So this is my second look, a closer look at this thing. The first time was very much rushed and from a far and at night with a press event. So this is a nice refresher. So now we've seen this before and a lot of you might remember most of it. But seeing it up close, I was able to notice a couple smaller things too. So this panel at the back left, I think is most likely covering up what would be a charging port. So I didn't see that before. You know, the door handles are these flush flat things kind of just like the body style of the Model S. So I assume they'll motorize out. It's the one thing that breaks a lot on a Tesla Model S, but it's great for Aero. So there's that. And here's a closer look at the wheels too, which makes the fact that these are just like Aero cap covers much more obvious. They definitely fit the aesthetic though because there are, as I remember, absolutely no curves to this truck. What so ever? Just hard lines and angles throughout the whole shape of this trapezoid on wheels, especially the corners.\\n\\nLike this truck legit has some sharp corners at the front and back edges, which is fine, I guess. I mean, it shouldn't touch anything. But I noticed I'm never the less. This will probably be the easiest vehicle in the world to wrap. So shout out to the wrap shops. I think it's worth saying that since this is the 2019 prototype, I shouldn't really put too much stock in like the small details because they could absolutely change. In fact, they probably will. Like we've seen footage of more cyber trucks being tested that have side view mirrors, for example, instead of just these cameras that this one has. We've also seen them experiment with like a gigantic single windshield wiper for this huge angular piece of glass at the front. But what I really took away from this second look from being able to get up close and stand right next to this thing is just how absolutely massive this truck is. This thing is huge. It's tall, it is wide. The back bed here is a good example just to get an idea. It's just expansive. It looks like it's about a six foot bed, maybe even a little longer. It's got the lights in it. It's got the mounting points for tying things down. There's also some panel back here that kind of looks like it might cover some power outlets potentially. But you know, with the high sides and the huge tailgate, this is a huge truck that you can fit a lot of stuff in.\\n\\nThe tailgate also has this extension with like this kind of grip tape on it that goes down to the ground level for something like the cyber quad to be able to just drive into the back of this thing. And no, the cyber quad is not small. It's an ATV. It's tough to appreciate really just how massive the truck is without some scale. I tried to get some shots with people next to it. I'm standing next to it, but yeah, the back of this thing you can already tell us huge. And then up front, it looks like there could still be plenty of room for a sizable front trunk. I'm actually hoping they do that. It looks like right above the headlight LEDs would be a bit high to reach for some people actually. But the way it's cut, I'm kind of thinking that's where it would have to be. But yeah, there's just a ton of space because of how big this is. So I think a front trunk would be sweet. And then this is me sitting down here at the bumper. Like I normally do with the other cars I shoot on this channel. And from down here, you can see like I can't even see the windshield at all. Like not even close. Which means that if someone was in the driver's seat, there's no shot they'd be able to see me sitting here or like really anything that's this close to the front bumper. Now I will make a note that the truck they have stage here is in this kind of loading mode with this suspension.\\n\\nSo you can see it's leaning back here to be able to drop the tailgate low to the ground and load things into the truck, which is a super cool feature. And that lets us see how massive of a difference there is between the suspension all the way up, which just looks like a ton of clearance. And then the suspension all the way down, which is probably how it'll arrive most of the time on the road and then the sportier modes. But yeah, that's a huge clearance. That's great for off-roading. But it probably won't ride that high at the front all the time. But still though, it's a good illustration of how huge this truck is. There's been some talk about possibly making it smaller in every dimension just by a little bit. It would not shock me at all if that ended up happening because when you see how many hundreds of thousands of pre-orders this truck has, there's like guaranteed a non-zero percentage of those people who are not ready for a truck this big. Like who don't realize that this won't fit in their driveway, it absolutely won't fit in their garage. And it's probably overkill size-wise for whatever they were imagining. But then, yeah, the last bit is, okay, they did reveal this a couple years ago and it still hasn't shipped. So guess what? The landscape of electric trucks is actually meaningfully different now. Like there's real competition on the road. So when they unveiled this, it was like the only electric truck. But now there is F-150 Lightning on the road already.\\n\\nRivian R1T is out there on the streets, even the Hummer EV. And so that got me thinking, what's the advantage of this Cybertruck gonna be? Now, obviously there's a lot of Tesla hype and people who want something unique. And this is definitely that. There's no mistaking this huge metal trapezoid dump truck on the road for anything else and people are gonna be into that. But besides that, I think the advantage basically just has to be price and range, right? F-150 Lightning is pretty premium but Rivian R1T is also $80,000 plus. The Hummer is well over $100,000. So if Tesla actually delivers what they promised, which is a huge if considering what's happened in the car market since then. But if they actually deliver this thing at, let's say, $50,000, $60,000. And with the Tesla Supercharging Network and 350 miles of range, then that's something the competitors don't have yet. Because competitors do have high end acceleration and driving performance. The competitors do have amazing off-roading capability. They do have storage and truck features and front trunks and all that other stuff. But the Cybertruck has these looks and the power of the Tesla drivetrain. So that is something to think about. Anyway, this will be an interesting one to keep an eye on. Along with all the other crazy stuff Tesla says they're doing, or Elon says Tesla's doing like this Optimus robot, which I also got a first look at in this museum, which looks absolutely unreal.\\n\\nI mean, it looks like just a robot you put in a museum that would never walk. But apparently this is the type of thing they want in people's houses. The Roadster also, you know, maybe someday. Maybe it'll exist. I don't know. There's also a Tesla semi truck out here, which is cool. But anyway, make sure you get subscribed to this channel to see all this good stuff. One, it finally ships because I will be taking a look at it for sure. Either way, thanks for watching. Catch you guys later.

       " Document(page_content=\"Yo, I am impressed. I am very very impressed with this car right here. This is the Tesla Model 3 the 2024 refresh a lot of people are calling it in Highland. That's not actually in the name, but this car I've only been testing it for maybe a week now, but I've noticed a lot of little things different the main way You're gonna be able to tell this car different from the already very popular model 3 that's out is a new distinctive Angular headlights the new point to your face, but there's a lot more that's new to this car that sort of add up to me to feel like a Honestly a worthy flagship. I know the Model S is you know higher-end and it has a plaid variant and all the performance and all that fun stuff But this is the this is the car that people are going to know and see the most often as a Tesla It's Model 3 in the Model Y so you can argue this is their most important car and it kind of feels now like a mini Model S So let's look at everything that's new so first of all like I said aesthetics are actually one of the big things So when you see these new sleek slim headlights That's how you know you're looking at the new Model 3 But also this is actually a new paint ultra red and I kind of feel like the Canon R5 is getting the color I can actually appreciate it. There's also a new stealth gray color, but I like the ultra red and Just right off the bat.\\n\\nIt's a little bit of a further down slope on the nose and It's always been a really simple car, but you can actually tell now it's a little bit more aerodynamic Which is going to give you a little bit better range?\\n\\nI've been driving this car for a couple days getting averaging well under 300 watt hours per mile and out of full-stated charge 330 miles of range in the cold this weather now It's it's a Tesla standard 30 miles of range So you're probably going to get more like 290 285 something like that But still the fact that it's getting the same range as what my plaid was getting is pretty impressive So officially the new drag coefficient is 0.219 and that's mostly going to come from the front of the car And the places that are hitting the most air from the side It's still going to look just like a normal Model 3 maybe you can tell that little Front shape is slightly different with a slightly lower nose, but slightly updated wheels too I'm really liking this Ultra red color But yeah, it looks like a Model 3 from the side until you get to the back Which is where you'll see the new tail lights and they are also pretty distinctive An angular and I think pretty nice Here's a maybe hot take The no Tesla logo It just says Tesla in text now on the back And at first I didn't really love that but I've started to get used to it So the only Tesla logo is actually on the front hood And if I want to open it up That power liftgate is the same as it's always been And you've got a pretty decent sized trunk but now you'll notice that those those tail lights are one piece So if I close this again you'll see That entire tail light is uninterrupted on the back trunk piece So it doesn't have any gaps at\\n\\nnight you just see one continuous light And I like that And they see dual motor This is not a performance trim This is just a standard Model 3 for right now And that's the back But most of the things that are new with this car again are very subtle things And a lot of them are on the inside in quality in materials And in making it feel and drive Like a much more comfortable It's just better just quality all around is higher So I'm going to start with the door Because that's actually the first thing you'll notice So the handle is the same and the way you get in is the same But if you've seen German cars you might have seen this little notch before And this little part here that plugs into the door In general there's a better seal To the entire door all the way around the cabin And that makes this a much quieter car When driving and even when getting inside I'll close it or behind me You probably can't tell But it's pretty quiet And so in general this really still feels very recognizably just like previous Model 3's But everywhere you look there's lots of little things In the direction of premium In the direction of comfortable And in the direction of luxury a little bit Not so much sporty And we'll talk about what I think might work for a performance Model 3 version of this Maybe a little later But let's look around So first of all this is the new steering wheel This I think is the only thing that anyone may have complaints about Because as you can probably notice right away\\n\\nThere's no more stocks So the Model 3 always had the stocks while the Model S and X didn't Now there's no more blinker stocks and there's no driver stocks So if you want to switch to drive You put your foot on the brake And swipe forward Or backward just like the Model S Or fun fact actually there's your perndle up here If you really I don't think most people are going to use that But in case of the screen not being on That's how you change gears But then the rest of the steering wheel is your buttons on the steering wheel So here on the right hand side that's going to be your windshield wipers Which you can also switch to automatic Your voice dictation And then this will turn on autopilot And if you want to turn up or down That's going to be the distance between you and the car in front of you Wall and autopilot Then on the left that's your blinkers Left or right blinkers are on the steering wheel in Model 3 now And your high beams And of course your your media and volume But that does mean the middle is a regular horn Not a button on the steering wheel And it is a pretty close to circular wheel So there are some things that people are going to like And there are some things that people are definitely going to have to get used to Like the no stocks But again this is this is in the theme it feels like to me of many model less So then everywhere else you look Improve materials and build quality I like this Alcantara It's nice and soft You've got all the same switches you\\n\\nnormally do And the door to get in and out Up here is just your air vents But it's kind of like this fabric here It's a pretty unique look Obviously you're going to have a lot of cars have your screen back here So this is just a very obvious plain open space But I kind of like this sort of a gray fabric And then all the way around the car Which you'll notice especially when you're driving Is this LED lighting So this light strip goes all the way around Up at the front all the way around the side of the car And yes you can change the look of it Just by dragging around and changing the color of the LEDs There's purple There's red Yellow Looks pretty good at night Just because it's again pretty continuous all around the car And then of course here is the main center console This screen has a faster computer And it is way more responsive Like all of the software and everything that you're doing this car Is just as fast as ever And often even faster than I remember Which is awesome And that's always good to see because Tesla has literally been The best software in any car that's not car player androdo For years now Also you may have noticed I've got this uh This new view of the parking spot I'm in Which if I pull for it a little bit you'll notice Zoom's out That is the new high fidelity park assist It's not a 360 camera But it's pretty close It gives you sort of this heat map of The things that are around you You can see the parking lines in the parking lot you're in And then\\n\\nyou'll see this little Heat Thing Based on how close you are to the thing behind you So I'm right against the curb now So that's why it's red It's decent I mean that's all improved with Tesla Model 3 These are also now softer, better seats in the front They are heated and ventilated And the back seats are also heated But I'm gonna show you something else And the back seat now that you might like even more So this is the back seat of the Model 3 It's about the same amount of space as before So if I'm getting behind A 6-3 driver's position That's it's not a ton of space But the floor is flat through the middle But look at that A nice flush touch screen With actually some pretty thin bezels Right on the back to control all of the airflow And the HVAC stuff And even a little bit of media if you want to On the back of this car This is a way better back seat experience Honestly this makes such a huge difference As a back seat passenger in this car I've been in the back of a lot of Model 3 Is that it's been ubers and things like that You still have also this LED lighting back here Again I like that these back seats are heated If you want them to be And then the glass over your head With plenty of headroom It's not quite the uninterrupted glass From the Model SNX But it's what we're used to from Model 3 and Y Which is still a whole lot of glass Let me get back up to the driver's seat Because there are a couple things too That are upgraded significantly Just when driving this car\\n\\nModel 3 has always been An easy car to drive I think it's very simple I know there's no stocks now But in general As far as electric cars This might be the easiest one to calibrate to One pedal driving wise Charging network wise just in general But two things One is acoustically It is so much quieter in here when you're driving Which is awesome And then it's a softer suspension noticeably softer This comes at the expense of maybe a bit of a sporty feeling I honestly think the old Model 3 and Y's coil suspension was a little harsh A little firm sometimes And I think a lot of owners would agree with that And this is made really big strides To be way more comfortable to drive And it also has a notably tighter steering radius That wasn't really advertised at all But that's really cool to see And then there's also a much improved speaker system So the speaker is in this car Just driving around In this quiet cabin Listening to the better speakers Is way way better than previously This really feels like a mini model S But still if you're a Model 3 fan You're gonna have some of the hits That you've always been used to The wireless chargers up here The key fob card And then this is the center console storage Which is a big center console spot And this one doesn't move like Model S But there's two cup holders That you can always close just like that And like that So you still got the front trunk spacer used to Still got the rear trunk spacer used to And honestly even the camera quality\\n\\nThese cameras when you look at the camera feed from the car Looks much better I can actually see rain drops Much more higher fidelity when I'm driving this car And the blinkers come on This is good man This is a good car So I think the general question you might be wondering Is should you get this car And the only thing I would say Is if you're considering something like a performance version of this Consider what you want to do most of the time when driving I think when street driving This thing is great Most of the time with street driving This thing is great And it's quick It's really quick I'll try to find an official 0-60 time Or some horsepower numbers if I can But for a car with this much range And with a great charging network Like this is a very quick EV A performance version for me would really only gain Maybe two things Obviously the ability to have track mode And be able to dial you know Your traction control To be front wheel driver Real world driver Change the slip Or have a little bit more fun while driving And then maybe getting back to A firmer suspension For that sort of Track oriented driving But for the non-performance version Which this is It's complete It's great It's a flagship It's a mini model S It's refined It's well built I'm very impressed By the new model 3 Let me know what you think Is this a car that you've been looking forward to I've been looking forward to seeing it In the US for so long It was like Europe first And then slowly making its way\\n\\nhere Now it's here And I'm happy I got to test it Because this thing's good man This is the car I would recommend So easily to anyone just looking for a first EV That's where I'll leave it Let me know what you think Thanks for watching Catch you in the next one Peace\", metadata={'source':

       " Document(page_content=\"Alright, so I feel like last time we did this video, last time I sat in this car, in this parking spot, on an Android phone and talked about EVs. I was talking about how the state of EVs is held back so much by charging. I could have got all these great electric cars, but I was talking about this experience of charging them being dramatically behind. This Tesla has got this huge advantage where they have built out this huge charging network and they have spent the billions and billions of dollars and now it is so much better to own a Tesla and drive around and charge using their network than it is to use any other, any public network, any electrified America, all that stuff. But clearly that has changed, so this kind of feels like a sequel to that video, so let's talk about what's happening here. So in North America, this is specifically North America, the ports that I'm talking about apply to North America here, but in North America we've got Tesla with their charging port, which they call NACS, the North American charging standard, but it's Tesla's port, they own it. And then there's everyone else, and most of them are using most amazing CCS, this open standard. And because there's so many Tesla superchargers out here that no other car other than Tesla's can use, a question that kept popping up was, when are we going to maybe be able to charge other EVs on Tesla superchargers? Wouldn't that be sick? Wouldn't that be a win for everyone?\\n\\nIt would be better for all of those EVs and Tesla could charge for it. And Elon kept tweeting about it, like, oh yeah, we'll make it available someday, sure. Yeah, oh, we're allowing it, we're allowing it, but like it never happened. And then a couple of weeks ago I made that video on the like three or four chargers that opened up Tesla superchargers with this magic dock. That had a CCS plug on the end so you could plug in any CCS car. There's like three or four of these chargers. And that was kind of cool, and that made my Rivian 3% better, but it was not very many chargers, but now we're starting to see this wave of actual collaborations with Tesla that are much more meaningful. It started with Ford, then it was GM, and then Rivian, and I'm starting to think by the time I post this video there might be another domino to fall, but essentially what's happened is the CEOs have gone, all right, you know what? Tesla superchargers are so far ahead and are so good that you know what, we're just going to put Tesla's port in our cars, and we're going to make Tesla superchargers available to all of our cars. It's not every single Tesla supercharger, but it's thousands of them. It's meaningfully, dramatically better for these cars. So like this started with Ford, right? And Ford CEO basically collaborated announced this and was like, all right, yeah. So starting in 2025, all four EVs will switch from the CCS port to Tesla's NACS port.\\n\\nWow, sick, and they'll be able to use thousands of Tesla superchargers and can still use the public charges if they want to, if they're willing or brave or daring enough, they can use those two, they can get a CCS adapter. But basically they become much better cars because they work on Tesla superchargers now. And then GM did it. And so that's all the Hummer EV and all the Cadillac lyrics and all of those. And then Rivian today was the last domino to fall and there'll be more. But yeah, this is this is a game changer and my take on this honestly is this is a win for everyone. So I can we can literally break this down who it's a win for. First of all, it's a win for us, the EV driver, because let's just take the Rivian, for example, I feel like it's pretty obvious that it's a much better product now that you can confidently road trip in a Rivian in North America. Because Tesla superchargers are that good, the uptime is that much better, they're that much more reliable. I just think that's a no brainer. That's a win for us people driving these cars or driving the cars of the future with that port. It's a win for the companies doing this like Ford GM and Rivian so far, because now all of their cars are better and all of the cars are better options because let's be honest.\\n\\nI think a lot of people would agree that these vehicles are better than the vehicles, Tesla's making so if you prefer a pickup truck or a five row of seven cedar SUV, whatever these options are that Rivian or Hummer or or Cadillac or these others are making. These are better vehicles. So now all of them become better and more likely to be bought by people who want to use them all the time. That's a win for the companies making them they'll get more customers and then it is a win for Tesla because of course they're getting paid. The logics of them getting paid are pretty straightforward, but they're even behind the scenes things like of course, okay, you'll need a Tesla account, you'll pay the ten bucks a month, you'll pay for the charging kind of like a gas station, Tesla's the new gas station maybe. But they're also I believe potentially eligible for government subsidy money. The government is paying for a bunch of charges to be made and they have to be able to charge lots of different cars to be eligible for the money. So they're going to get a lot of money for that to Tesla wins might might only be a little bit too much of a win for Tesla when you look forward into the future at potential monopoly status. But there's a couple of things to consider. Rivian is one of those companies who has said they're going to continue investing in and building their own network their adventure network.\\n\\nEven though they are now going to be switching to any CS and they also I remember I talked to RJ the CEO on our podcast and one fact and listen to that episode real quick. Check out this clip real quick where he actually addresses Tesla superchargers. There's been a massive under investment in charging infrastructure. It's just like a couple of Tesla chargers that have added this adapter that can work in a show up in the map, which is great. Do wish there were more open on Tesla's network. Yeah, I think that I think more will open on Tesla's network. We've the Rivians can charge on that on Tesla's network where they're open. The way I think about it is over time, I hope charging starts to become more ubiquitous and it becomes less of an issue. If you asked me, it sounds like he had a hunch that this was coming or that this was a possibility. But the point is the density of chargers available for all of these cars just got dramatically better or at least will be in 2024 and 2025 when they switched to the new port. And that's a win for everyone buying those cars, everyone driving those cars and the port itself is really good. I think that's a little bit of an underrated thing, the thin cable, the incredibly well made chargers in the first place and the more easily maneuverable end of the cable. It's a good plug. So I see this as a pretty pretty much a win all the way across the board. Yeah, so this this feels like a good sequel slash part two. I'll leave it at this.\\n\\nI still do actually hope that public chargers slow level two chargers and all sorts of other chargers that are just sort of floating around that aren't in the Tesla network continue to get better because one, I think there will always be a delta between all Tesla Superchargers access or some Tesla Superchargers access. I believe Tesla has to keep some for themselves to have some advantage to buying a Tesla over another EV. I think that will be their main advantage. And I also just want Tesla and charging in general just be better across the board. And so if you watch the rest of that interview with RJ, he talks about them investing heavily in their own charging network and putting them in specific places that make sense for rivians. Rivians are adventure vehicles. So you won't really find Tesla Superchargers at national parks or in forests or campsites, but you will find Rivians adventure network there. So they can be more specialized and if you buy a river, it'll make sense to use those sometimes. So I hope that investment continues from these companies, but now they kind of have less pressure to do that mass highway adoption of just putting these things all over the place because Tesla's been doing that. It's a good look. Who do you think is the next domino at a fall? It could be lucid. It could be Hyundai. It could be Mercedes, pole star. Maybe even there's a lot of there's a lot left on the tail, but I think we're going to see some more, which is a good thing.\\n\\nAlright, that's been it. Thanks for watching. Catch you the next one.

       "{'context': [Document(page_content=\"Okay, so here's the thing about a minivan. Everyone can agree on one thing, which is a minivan is very practical, very livable. If you need to go on a trip or if you have a lot of people you're taking with you, a big family, car seats, minivans are like the most livable thing, but nobody really wants a minivan. That's beyond us. Like you get one out of practicality, but you're not really desiring a minivan. But what if you could get a minivan in disguise? What if you could get a practical 3-row SUV that has all the features of a minivan, but isn't a minivan? Now we're talking. So this here, this is the Kia EV9. It's actually two different specs of the EV9, but I've been living with this thing for about a week now, driving it every day, and I'm telling you right now, it's not missing anything. 3-row, fully electric SUV, full size, lots of space, and all the things that you think of when you think, okay, minivan, here's what I need, here's the space I need, the features and practicality I need, it has all of it. But then of course you have to contend with the fact that it's electric and it's a Kia, and every time I do this, I review a Kia and it's like, this is the highest end, fully option GT, it's like $75,000. If you take the Kia logo off of it, I think we can all agree, very compelling. For the cheapest 3-row fully electric SUV, it's really good, it's not missing anything.\\n\\nBut then you put the Kia logo back on it, and then you think, hmm, do I want to spend $75,000 for a Kia? But stay with me, I think you might be convinced by this one. So first of all, there's several trims of this thing. This is the one I've been driving in this ocean blue, which I think looks sick, but I'll get to it in a second. Over here, we have a lower end trim, which has a little more silver trim. It actually has a metallic paint job, but slightly fewer options. This thing starts in rear wheel drive at $55,000. It's called the light. Then there's the wind, which is all wheel drive. That's $64,000. Then the land is $70,000, and then the GT, this is basically fully optioned everything you can possibly get, starting at $74,000. But now think about its competition, because I'm driving this the whole time thinking about the other options you could get as far as three row fully electric. You've got Tesla Model X, Rivian R1S, which I love. I've done a video about that. Then you've got maybe the future escalade when it comes out, or maybe one or two others that are right about to come out. This is the cheapest one. But they've really managed to cram a lot of stuff in here. Then it's just a materials choice. So first of all, I'm going to start with the key. I've showed you guys the key before I review the EV6, but the same idea here is got, I mean, first of all, I like this key because you can sit on it in your back pocket, and not accidentally hit any buttons. Small detail.\\n\\nBut you got that lock button there, pretty sweet lights. Then if I have the car locked here, and I flip it over, and I hit that whole button, so I got to be really close to it just to make sure it works. But I hold that for a few seconds. It lights up, and then I can hit forward or backward. And it'll actually move the car by itself into or out of its parking space, which is pretty cool. There's nobody in the car. But I'm sort of a dog walking this fully electric full-size vehicle wherever I want. Let go, move it backwards, I guess. I have to be close to it for it to start. But let's move it backwards. Go ahead. Go ahead, move it back into the spot. Perfect. And part. Easy. It has the lights on the front, which is a good opportunity to show you that. These little pixel lights on the front here light up in a different welcome animation based on whichever one you choose in the settings. Now I already liked and showed you guys how much I liked the other electric he is. I think they're one of the brands doing the best job at like reinventing themselves with a new aesthetic for their electric vehicles. And the EV9, I think, is just as good looking as the other stuff too. It's got this little animation stuff happening, but also these big DRLs. It's beeping out because it doesn't like leaving the lights on, but now it's turning off. Also you might have seen that move.\\n\\nThat's some active aerodynamics to open up and let the air in for cooling some stuff or to close it up to be a little more aerodynamic. And just walking around this thing. So the fundamentals are great. Big long wheel base, as you can see, but basically the same length of a body as a telluride, just more space between the wheels. So then between those wheels is a 99.8 kilowatt hour battery. It's going to get an EPA estimated 270 miles of range. I found that to be close to accurate, maybe 250-ish. It's pretty big. And then the GT is going to have the most horsepower, 379 horsepower and 516 pound-feet of torque. And that doesn't sound like a lot for something that's pretty big, full-size and electric, so it weighs a lot. But it is still pretty zippy for a dual motor all-wheel drive, three-row, not quite mini-van. And then they've been doing this interesting look with the wheels. I'm going to go over to this one first because it's even more distinct. It's got this silver triangle sort of aero cap look on the wheel. This is what he is doing to try to make their EVs look a little more modern and distinct. And it looks weird at first, but I kind of don't hate it for some reason. Then I'll come around to this one over here. And this one's a little more normal looking, but it's all black. And I almost at first thought I could remove these little panels here like they're plastic, but nothing seems to come off. So it's a 21-inch wheel on the GT.\\n\\nAnd this is about as aerodynamically efficient as you can make it on the front. Well, there is a front trunk, by the way. This is a ground-up EV and they have left enough room to put stuff in the front. It's not very big. I don't know how much you're going to use this, but in the rear wheel drive versions, this is about twice as big. So it's like a backpack space here now, but maybe a full carry-on if you don't have the all-wheel drive version. But close that. Come around the side. You have this black mirror cap here with the blinker. Like a light on the side. These auto recess when you're driving. And these are some big doors. And I was just noticing how heavy they are when we were opening these doors and closing them, but huge, seal, huge door here. And we'll get back to the quality of materials in a second. But all this black trim on the GT, I think, looks nice. And then look at that side profile. That's good. It's not a minivan. It's not a minivan. But if we get around to the back here, you can start to see it looks maybe a little more standard. I'll show you those tail lights. I still think they look pretty good because they're these big tall tail lights here. But maybe that's a little more mini-vany from the rear profile. Fine. Same as a tell-you-ride, a little bit, I guess, a little bigger. But okay, power opening, rear trunk, behind the third row. And let me know if you think that's practical enough for you. Again, there's three rows in here.\\n\\nSo this is just a storage behind the third row. So that's definitely enough for a couple of bags, maybe some carry-ons back here. Obviously, groceries will fit. There's also a tiny little bit of a sub-tronk. So that's already kind of occupied by some stuff. And you have your charging cables right here. But also, full on outlet back here. And then some buttons to power fold the second row, which you can't reach from back here. So that's good. But folding these back seats as easy as grabbing this. And if the headrests are down, then it folds flat right into the back space right there. So this is going to start to feel minivan. But I think practical is the way we're looking to use here. So now, two rows of seats and a lot of rear trunk space. But I want to pull these back up because I want to show you guys what the inside of the car is like with all three rows up. So you kind of have to do this with two hands. Pull this rope back up and then let go. But let's make our way to the inside because it's more impressive than walk around the outside. So let's get into EV9. It's kind of tall. Nice little roof rack. Also, how is it always so loud here? Okay. Inside the EV9. So a couple things stand out right away. If you've seen the EV9 review a lot of this will be familiar. But some of it's actually even better. It's more updated. It's more spacious. But there is a good amount of plastic.\\n\\nSo if you're not okay with a lot of plastic and a $75,000 vehicle, this one might be a little bit of a bummer. But again, my key is it's not missing anything. Like it has every feature I would want in this trim. So that also does mean there's a lot of buttons. But if I put my foot on the brake right in here, that's where you power it up. I was kind of not really into that positioning. I kind of would either want a button around here somewhere or just no button at all. Foot on the brake. But you know, leave these these days. They've got power buttons. I'm glad that these are physical buttons too. So you can bump up the temperature or bump it down right here and you've got your fan speed up and down. So I love that. That's always good to see with HVAC controls. But then it starts to get cool. Down here, look at this. This is a USB port, USB type C port right here. But you've got a button right here to switch it between battery so charging only or USB data to the car and battery. So if you just want power to charge, boom, you're there. If you want data for your screens, then that's there. Push button. I've never seen that before. Actually, that's kind of cool. You've got the storage in the middle. And of course, you can see all the ambient lighting kind of around the middle of the car. This little garage door slides back. It's kind of plastic, but it still works. It does what it's supposed to and this push button makes cup holders out of this space.\\n\\nSo if you want to organize it a little more carefully, you can do that or just let it be free open space if you'd like to. I'll close that. My phone's down here on the wireless charger and that's your indicator to make sure you're charging. If that out, it turns off. You've also got your camera controls. You've got brake auto hold, a fingerprint reader to log into your profile. And my favorite part down here, the pedals have a plus and a minus button. Just, you know, because you're going forward and then breaking. So like more and then less energy. I don't know. It's plus or minus speed. But basically all this paneling is, it's pretty basic. Like this is what you'd find in a Honda Odyssey plus a little bit of lighting, right? It's there is no real leather in this car. So all this is going to be fake leather and, you know, plastic feeling, but you've got a heated steering wheel. You've got heated seats right here. Love that. Memorize two different heated seating positions as well. Also ventilated seats. It's not missing anything. What else do you have? You have the opposite of the Fisker. You have a gigantic sun visor here, which has a gigantic mirror and a huge light. That's actually kind of soft. You also have an HUD up there, which is very welcome. You also have a mirror here, which can be a regular mirror or a camera mirror. Love seeing that, especially if you have rear passengers. You probably want to go with the camera mirror.\\n\\nYou also have a manually shaded or wide open sunroof that opens and is motorized. So that's pretty sweet. Also back there you can shade even more glass above the back passengers and very welcome to see wireless car play and Android Auto. So again, my phone's over here, not plugged in, but guess what? Car play. Works great, especially if it's down here on this where I was charger. But I actually want to give a quick shout out to Kia's software. This might be my hot take of this video, but I think Kia... All right, bro. Chill. I think Kia's software might be the most responsive. Definitely top three most responsive car software I have ever used. Because you know how sometimes you watch car videos and people are like, oh wow, the infotainment, it's very smooth, it's responsive and then they swipe. And it's like 12 FPS and you're like, we have iPads that look better than this for $200. Like what are you talking about? This is actually really good. So again, you can jump in car play, but look at this. This is actually pretty good. You jump into maps, you can jump into all the media stuff is here. Plus you still have like car play lined up here. Now I'd never use the maps built in. That's... It's not great. But if you do and you navigate to a charger with the built-in nav, it will actually precondition the car's battery knowing you're about to get to a charger.\\n\\nSo if you do want that to happen, you have to use the built-in maps otherwise maybe run them at the same time with car play. I don't know. Anyway, this is a lot of screen. Like 30 inches of screen, but it's touch screen all the way to this point right here. So you do still have like HVAC controls if you want to jump in here and do AC and temperature and sync up and do whatever. All that stuff is still indicated on that touch screen, but then all this touch screen stuff. This is actually good. I don't know why you'd want weather in the car. You're already outside, I guess. I don't know. The future weather, I guess that's neat. You have a search, which works decently well, but you can find some features. Not all of them are actually going to show up. Media, setup, it's good. This is car play. This is the media that's being pumped into the car right now and then set up for a bunch of other basic stuff. So vehicle stuff, settings, if you have EV stuff, that's your charging, which your battery status is currently at. This is good. I am very happy with the software in the EV9. Now, I don't want to forget about the rest of the space in this car because real quick, these driver seats, while they're not leather, they are very soft and they're comfortable. They even have these like active bolsters where if you go into sport mode or go over a certain speed, they'll hug you.\\n\\nThey'll do a little bit more and these headrests, these might be the softest headrests I've ever felt mainly because they're like gel and they also kind of have this mesh so they're kind of like a herm and miller office chair. It's really good. But of course, there's more rows. So let's go to the back seat. The second row seats is going to be really telling about how much space is in this car. Big heavy door. Let's jump into the second row. So now I've got myself a good amount of leg room, plus little storage here behind a 6-3 driving position. And I'd say that's a pretty good spot for a road trip, not too bad. If I close this door here, comfy. And interestingly, this is the six row setup. So it's two in the front, the captain seats in the middle, and then two in the back. You can also get a three row middle, but I think a lot of people, many van people, you know, this convenient access is pretty nice. And these chairs, I saw some other videos of these particular chairs in the EV9 swiveling around so you can like face the back seats if you wanted to or like put a car seat facing the other way, whatever. It doesn't do that in this vehicle in the US. I think anywhere in North America, it might just be Korea. So unfortunately, these don't swivel, but they do have armrests and they do have nice headrests, and they're comfortable too. Now the third row test, that's the fun one, because I remember the back seat of the R1S. And even though I like that vehicle, it's pretty small.\\n\\nPut the headrest up. This is also pretty small. So 6-3 here, 6-3 here, 6-3 here, not great. I don't really want to be in the back seat of this for more than a couple of minutes, but if you have some smaller people like, let's say, what many van people usually have. Oh, I don't know. Kids, then this is totally fine. In the back seat still has multiple cup holders, USB type C, speakers in the back. It's got the air vents everywhere. It's got that glass roof over the top. It's not missing anything. But let me crawl back out of the back seat real quick. I'm already getting cramped, but there's still some stuff I want to show you. Obviously, second row is more comfortable. You have all this ambient lighting you can see here, the blue and green, sort of and right look. And this is harder with one hand, but I can show you that there is storage back here. There's a drawer, so you can put stuff here. Or if you pop this back, storage inside this thing. So you can keep your charging cables or whatever other stuff you want to put in there. Pop that closed. Nice. In a lot of ways, this is the easiest spec of this vehicle to review because it just has everything. It even has not a huge screen, but a little screen overhead for your air conditioning controls for the back seat. Turn up, turn down temperature, whatever you want to do, fan speed. You also have these little nets over to the side on the windows to the left or to the right.\\n\\nSo if you want to mesh, give yourself a little bit of a shade. Sunshade's there. Also, USB type C on both of these seats for the back seat. And if you want to bump up your legroom a little bit, you can even move that passenger seat forward backward from a button on the side of it from the back seat. So I am honestly finding it hard to say that I would pick the Rivian R1S for anything much more than just build quality. The Rivian is obviously, well maybe it's not obvious, but it's quicker. It has 800 something horsepower, so it should be quicker. It's more off-road capable. But if you look at all the sort of a minivan spec, minivan capabilities, like, okay, it doesn't have air suspension, but the dampers on this thing are tuned very well to the point where it always drives soft. It rides really nice. It's got these big wheels, but it absorbs pot holes. It's got this nice sophisticated rebound. It sort of drifts a little bit over bigger bumps, but other than that, it's fine. It just rides smooth. Now in case you're wondering, I know most people who would buy a minivan or an EB9 probably don't care, but there is a drive mode button right here, and if you press it, your drive modes are normal, sport, my drive, snow, and eco. So I think in eco, you can decouple the front and rear motors, and sometimes be only single motor drive, which is going to be more efficient. I can go back to normal, and normal just drives around as soft and pillowy as can be no problem.\\n\\nThis ability is great. Speakers are pretty good, a little bit lacking in base, but honestly totally fine. I talked about the camera mirror already, like, dang, they thought of everything. Man, I think Kia has been shockingly high on my power rankings of electric cars that I would buy. They have truly, let me lock it. They have truly reinvented themselves with the aesthetics and the feature set of their electric cars. Now word on the street is there's going to be an even faster GT version of the EB9. That's insane, totally unnecessary. That's cool too if you want that. Probably will have less range though. But as a general power rankings for three-row electric vehicles, if you made me pick one now, again, you're picking between R1S, 90 grand, Tesla Model X, 90 grand, and this, 50 to 75 grand. So you can say yes, I'm paying a lot of money for a Kia, but also you could say I'm not paying a lot of money for 250 to 280 miles of range, 200 plus Kilowatt charging, not a lot of road trips, basically a minivan, fully electric, totally silent, smooth, three rows, a lot of space, a lot of features. This thing's pretty good. What do you think? Which one would you pick? Thanks for watching. Get to the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/The_Kia_EV9_is_Surprisingly_Good_.txt'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"This car is almost perfect. It's so good. I love it. I've enjoyed it. The time I've driven in it has been awesome, but I could not recommend it because there is one thing that is a deal breaker. It's a pretty classic deal breaker. So let's talk about the Kia EV6 GT. So I started seeing a lot of EV6s around on the road. I got really curious about it. This is the GT version, so it's the slightly fast, well, a lot faster, sportier, more fun to drive version of the EV6. But I'd seen these around. I got curious about it. So getting to actually drive it was going to be really eye-opening. And I never thought I would like a Kia this much. I think that's what it comes down to. This is a really, really solid and unbelievably fun vehicle to drive. So let's get into the good things and you'll see what I mean by the deal breaker in a second. So you can see by the shape what the EV6 is. It's a hatchback. It's four doors. It's got a decent amount of space and it's fully electric. And then like I said, there is a regular EV6 that's not the GT. So a couple of ways to be able to tell that you're looking at a GT version is these vertical slats and these design details up here in the grille. These are also vertical design details. There's a little bit more aggressive angles. The rear diffuser looks a little better. But the easiest way is the neon green. So these brake calipers 21 inch wheels. It's on winter tires right now, but the neon green definitely GT.\\n\\nAnd then it has the same shape as the regular EV6, which I really like. It's kind of a teardrop shape. And in general, looks quite nice. It's like kind of a model Y height. That might be its most direct competitor. A little bit lower than my Sangmaki GT. But then also back here, you've got the sporty spoiler. So that's another way of seeing you've got the GT. This part here sort of tilts up and acts a little bit like a spoiler. And then you've got EV6 over here and GT down there. Honestly, I think it's a great looking car. I've seen a lot of actually a lot of satin ones on the road. There's like this satin gray color. This one, this red one here is called. Can we read that? Runway red? Pretty classic cherry red. But let's get more into the details. So first of all, to hatchback. This is the key for it. I've seen some of these keys that have this like forward and backward out of parking spaces. I've not been able to get them to work unfortunately, but the rest of the keys pretty solid. Hold here to open the hatchback and we'll get a look at those lights. And getting into the back of the EV6. There's a good amount of space. So a pretty classic telltale sign of way of knowing that the car that's electric that you're looking at wasn't built from the ground up to be electric. Is if it doesn't have like extra features over the gas powered version. Like this one that it has a tiny front trunk, a little 20 liter front trunk.\\n\\nBut honestly, I think the space in the back here of the EV6, it's a little less than the GT because it's got a bigger rear motor. But I would say that this is pretty good still too. The tire mobility kit and show you tiny slot down here for charging cables and a good normal amount of room for grocery use. These all fold flat. For a $65,000 car, it'd be cool if these wouldn't. Oh, let's see if I can. Okay, they won't come back up automatically, but that's a good amount of space. That's a good amount of space. There are no lights in the trunk, but you do get that button to close it. And here's a better look at the rear at the lights, which I also really like. Nice tail light bar all the way across here. This is the blinker. And this is the electric charge port, which I do have to go into the car to open, which I wish there was a button on the key for it, but right here anyway, push that. And it's an almost CCS port, which is probably a good time to address the elephant in the room, which is this car's biggest downfall, which is its range. I didn't quite catch that. Could you please say that again? I said it's probably a good time to address this car's biggest downfall. It's range. So the EV6 GT has more powerful motors and is faster and sportier than the regular EV6, but it didn't get a bigger battery pack. And so with its 77 kilowatt hour battery, it has a max range of 200 miles, 200 miles. It does have 350 kilowatt charging.\\n\\nIt is a pretty accurate 170 to 200 miles on a full battery if you charge 200 percent every time. But that's about half of what I would hope to get for $65,000, 200 miles. So that's the challenge here. Like this is the shape of a really practical everyday type of car, which the EV6 is. It's got the back seats and we'll go inside in a second, but it's got the performance and the fun and the sportiness combined with practical just minus the practical range to do any sort of road tripping. Maybe you can do like commuting every day. I've done commuting and I have a 30 mile commute and it's gone well before the end of the week. I have to recharge. So this is something to think about. It's a deal breaker for me. I couldn't recommend or buy this, but now knowing that, let's get into some of the more interesting details here. So it's got these door handles that sort of pop out. Look at that. We can get in. Nice little entrance. And here we are in the cockpit of the EV6 GT. There's a power button here. It does say EV and that's your power. And then this is your drive shifter to shift to drive or to park. Break hold, parking cameras and music. No, no, no. So okay, some things that I love here and some things that I don't. First of all, there's a little bit more GT happening. There is a GT button on the steering wheel, which will change drive modes. And I'll talk about the driving in a second.\\n\\nBut there's also, you'll notice, these really sporty GT bucket seats, which are very comfortable. They're really nice. They're also heated along with the steering wheel with three different levels. And that's also great. But generally, this like neon green thing is how you know you're looking at a GT. And I do really like these seats. Shout out to the back seats, which are also heated, not ventilated, but there's also a full-size power outlet back there and a good enough legroom. Good materials. It's a Kia. I mean, you're going to be pretty used to the classic like glossy plastic brushed metal, but fake plastic again. Plastic here. A lot of plastic up here and some rubberized materials. This is this is probably where you'd say you don't want to spend 65 grand on a car like this. But I do think it's well put together. It's just not expensive. Materials now we got to get to this part. This is the part. This is the auto focus part right? The technology in the car and how you interact with it. I could give this whole system like a B- or a C plus up here. It's going to remind me a lot of the Ionic 5. So this is a relatively responsive pieces software. It's your computer. You do have the screen behind the steering wheel, which is great to 84% 176 miles. This is the Achilles heel. I mean, I've seen as highs like 213 miles, I think, with 100% battery. But you can dig in the settings here. The navigation is decent and it will navigate you to chargers and you can do a whole bunch more.\\n\\nI say this because yes, this car has Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. But it's not wireless. Okay. So there's a nice little spot for the wireless charger here. You can pop your phone in there. It fits a huge phone. This is an S23 Ultra. This turns orange when you're charging. It turns green when it's done charging. But then this is my navigation and it doesn't beam it up here wirelessly. Instead, you would have to use one of these two cables down here, which means your phone is going to end up down in this tray. And as you drive around, it kind of slams around in there, which is not ideal. So you could do that and it'll charge your phone wired and you'll get it up here. But this is like a natural place to pop your phone when you get in the car. So it's kind of unfortunate that it doesn't have wireless car playing Android Auto. Nevertheless, the software is capable, right? It's got even these crazy settings that will do the sound that the car makes as you're driving. So how it responds to the accelerator pedal, the exact sounds that it makes. You can kind of do this rumbling sound if you're into that. The bottom line is there's a lot here and it's fine. It's fine in the layout. I wish there is the wireless car play element, but that works for me. You also get your parking cameras here and you do have a little walk around camera. So you do get a white one no matter what color your spec is, fine, whatever is functional. It works.\\n\\nThis is a very wide angle camera, but it's also functional. You get used to it. So yeah, generally pretty good software. This part though, a little annoying, I will say, because by default, you can see that says volume power. And when I change this, it's a volume knob for your audio. My phone's connected. That's going to be volume. HVAC controls, I must go in and hit this little notch here to switch it to HVAC controls. Now this is a temperature selector, right? So this little knob has two different functions depending on if you hit this touch target or not. It makes sense. You can get used to it. It's just this little touch target is kind of small. So sometimes I'll jump in the car and think I'm doing one thing, but if I miss, then I'm doing the other thing suddenly the lines way up when I want to turn it up with the heat. You know, a little bit of nitpicky, but this is the type of stuff that I think you could probably improve with a few more real switches or real buttons. I think Ionic 5 kind of learn the same lesson. It is what it is. But let's talk about driving. So this is turned out to be probably the most fun EV you can drive under 70 grand. I'd say that because the only other option there would be like mock egt, Tesla model Y, the Taycan is is every bit as fun, but it's very expensive. So that's going to come down to your performance figures and how capable this Kia is. I've been very impressed.\\n\\nThis is first of all dual motors all wheel drive, 580ish horsepower, talking about 0 to 60 in low to mid threes, and it pulls. It really keeps pulling just a blast to drive. And then on top of the straight line performance, very balanced and very fun and engaging to actually move around. So you've got this drive mode button here on the steering wheel. You can hit that and see that it switches between these three drive modes, Sport, Eco, and Normal. But if you want to have a little bit more fun, I mean, this changes a bunch of settings all the types of things like the suspension, dampening, softening, accelerator pedal, responsiveness. But as soon as you want to have a little more fun, there's this GT button over here. Press that GT button. Everything turns the neon green. So you might not have noticed this, but you can kind of see these little things lighting up here. There's a lot of ambient lighting all around the car. For these three modes, it's Eco, Normal, those are blue, Sport turns everything red. But then neon green GT is going to be your full power. Traction control turns off by default. And it lets you have a little bit more fun with the way this car can approach its own limits. And it's sick. Now the one other thing you can get out of this GT button is a personalized my drive mode. And the cool thing about that is you get to choose every single little thing. So steering response, acceleration response, suspension.\\n\\nSo I have everything in Sport Plus, but you might want to do Sport Plus, but with a softer suspension or with a little bit more traction control. All these types of things can be adjusted in your own driving mode. And that's the one that I drove in the most often. That's also the one that's going to get you, you know, roughly 200 miles of range. Eco can get you a bit more. And it does appear to turn off the front motors in Eco, but it doesn't it doesn't do a ton as far as total range you can get. So it's a car you have fun in and then have to charge very quickly. In its sportiest setting in the GT mode, the car, it seems to shrink around you. It feels smaller than it really is. Even though visibility is great, and there's a glass sunroof in everything, I just mean like it feels very nimble and tight quick. And then you saw GT mode has traction control off or at least reduced. So it allows for some slip, you know, some understeer, some playfulness. I love it for back roads because it really lets you stay on the power more through curves and play with it a little bit. But that's unlike the sport mode, which is closer to a lot of other cars, which, you know, cuts power, limits any slip, and most of the time keeps you planted when the wheel is turned. Either way, it's great to have both. And the bigger brakes on the GT are also great. Maybe my only nitpicky driving complaint is that steering is, you know, kind of video gamey because there's not a ton of actual feel.\\n\\nBut also the firmest suspension setting is just a little bit bouncy sometimes, just a little bit. There is also a drift mode. I didn't try it. It's in New Jersey on winter tires. I'm not trying to do that on a public road, but it's there. Oh, also such a minor detail, but on the steering wheel, this is volume up. This is volume down. Makes perfect sense. This is previous track, and this is next track. I think that's backwards. But you know what? That's the idea. That's what a lot of people are looking for in a car, right? Let me just open the front trunk real quick so I can at least show you it. The combination of practical and fun, practical and fun. I think with this Kia, you get 75% of the practical and a 90% of the fun. I think they maybe could have gone to the absolute maximum of practical if they had designed this around having maybe a little bit more storage space up at the front. I mean, that's literally almost nothing. You could fit a bagel in there maybe. But the fun part is pushed about as far as I think you could at this price. It's awesome. So if I'm thinking about who should buy this car, who would I actually recommend this car to? Not a lot of people would want to drop 65 grand on a Kia. Let's be real. But the people who would spend 65 grand on this are also going to be considering things like the Mach E GT, the Tesla Model 3 performance or Model Y performance. Things in this price range that are high fun and high practical.\\n\\nAll of those will have more range in this, dramatically, every single one, like by at least 100 miles. And so that's going to be the Achilles heel of this GT. It's so much fun and it's just such a pain to charge two thirds or 60% more often than the others. I really wish I could love it more. But that's the thing. That's holding it back. That's the thing, Kia. It's the thing. It's so close. Please make a version with 110 kilowatt hour battery or something. This is 77 and you charge up to 100% every day and it does this thing but please make a high battery pack version. Please. Okay, it's my only request. That's it. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/Kia_EV6_GT_Almost_Perfect_.txt'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"Alright, so this is not a true question, real question. Why would you buy a smaller, less practical version of an already pretty established well-liked crossover SUV? Well, because it looks sick, that's the obvious real answer, that's why. So Hyundai has been doing a pretty great job lately. They've got this lineup now that has the Ionic 5, which I talked about, it's the crossover, and then the Ionic 6, which is this sedan built on the same platform, and then the Ionic 7, which is going to come later, it's going to be this larger SUV. But with this car, Hyundai has done a lot of things right. I really like it. I'm almost kind of spoiling it at the beginning of the video. It does actually sort of look like the shape of a magic mouse, which might be the worst thing about it. Actually, hold that thought. The worst thing about this car easily is this key. What happened? The design here was so sick, and then this key is like this cheap plastic looking like almost like a toy, like a tomogachi toy or something like that. I don't know. It's functional. It works. It's just I, whatever. It's the weirdest part about it. But let's just start with the design because this is the biggest difference between this and the Ionic 5 is, well, it's a full size sedan now instead of a crossover. And so get all the benefits and all the technical drawbacks of having a bit less space. But I really like this. So like I said, we're looking at a car that's built on the same platform as the Ionic 5.\\n\\nSo similar wheelbase, maybe even the same wheelbase. You've got 20 inch wheels here with all season tires. And it's doing the classic EV thing where it looks really sporty. But then you see a whole bunch of arrow covers in these spots to make it a little bit more efficient. And so speaking of efficiency, this all-wheel drive version with dual motors will get about 250 miles of range out of a 77 kilowatt hour battery. Now for the money, I would prefer a bit more range. I'd like to see somewhere in the 300 plus mile range for $50,000. But it does support a 350 kilowatt charging back here at the few chargers that actually support that. So if you can find an electrified American charger or something at a super high rate of speed, you can get from 10 to 80% in under half an hour, which is pretty sweet. But I think what's the most interesting about Ionic 5 is the design. I mean, I'm getting a lot of baby Porsche vibes back here. And it still keeps a lot of the really cool like pixel art design from the lights. Ionic 5 did the same thing. The spoiler light back up here. And then of course the front lights and the mirror lights all have this pixel design that I'm a huge fan of. Like what do you think of this front? It is unique to me. I think some people said it looked a little bit model three with the headlights, but again, if I hit the lights here, you can see these are the daytime running amber LEDs and then you get the headlights in here that look really sick. I'm a fan.\\n\\nIt's got the sort of an angular front. Apparently these front flaps can open. I haven't seen them do that in this weather in the Northeast, but that's pretty cool too. And then no front trunk, but that's the front side. I'll show you here technically. I'll show you exactly what we're working with. I said no front trunk, but you can if you really want to open up the front. And this is theoretically a front trunk. I mean, I don't know half a backpack. I can't fit my real backpack in there. If you got a laptop, maybe I don't know that technically exists, but there's a whole bunch of other electronics up here that contribute to the front trunk being tiny. So I think we should look at the real trunk. So here's the rear end. Look at this thing. Ionic 5 got the silver badging almost a sort of iconic vertical lights here around this diffuser. And then you've got this little pixel themed button alongside the rear view camera, power opening lift gate and a pretty good size trunk. I mean, it's just it and it's not gigantic. But a little bit of sub trunk space for your charging stuff. This pops down here. And I think that's solid golf clubs, check suitcases, check luggage, check multiple backpacks, check. This vehicle is started to win a lot of awards lately. And I'm fairly sure it's because it has all of the basic check box. It has a decent range. It has a relatively reasonable entry starting price of $45,000. And the design and feature set is pretty unique and desirable.\\n\\nThere's even like a vehicle to load charging feature where you can charge other things from the charge port of the car, which is pretty cool. But this big, slopie back. This is what it's all about. This is what you're getting instead of the Ionic 5's like big open hatchback being a crossover. Now again, if I'm going to get this, which has so many good angles and so many ways it looks really good. But if I'm going to get this over the Ionic 5, the back seat is probably not one of my biggest priorities. But I want to show it to you anyway. So these door handles fold flush. And then when you open them, they just pop open like this. I've got color door jams, Ionic six little plastic plaque here. This is a six three driving position. And I'm going to step in here. I think that's pretty good. Now, being a sedan, yeah, the back seat is a weakness compared to the Ionic 5. It's not going to be as good of an experience. It's still pretty good as a sedan, but things like this sloping roof line, which look cool from the outside are a little bit encroaching on the headroom if you're six three like I am. But the floor is flat. There's a good amount of leg room like I showed you. And then there's just a whole lot of minimalism. This feels like a well thought out but still minimal interior. Look at this stuff. Like I'll talk about materials in a second, but two USB C ports back here, a little bit of storage vents, but also full outlet 110 volt out with down here.\\n\\nYou got nets, you got a really simple armrest with just cup holders, flat floor. And again, like I said, decent leg room. And it's not some huge gigantic sunroof. It's actually just the moon roof over the front two passengers, which can be covered or open if you want it to. But it just it feels like this car is winning the awards because of the minimal, but very direct design like this pixel pattern here. These nice lines and stripes, pretty minimal door. It's not like the materials are amazing, but it's very well thought out visually and the aesthetics sort of match the entire cabin all the way around. So I think they've done a good job. But let's talk materials and a lot more of that stuff in the front seat. So here we go. Front seat cockpit experience. This is the priority of a vehicle like this. If you're going to get it over on a five, you want it to motorize you into place. And here we go. So this is again getting into the territory of, would you spend $45 to $55,000 on a Hyundai? Does that matter to you? Or is it just about the actual experience of the individual vehicle? I can't speak for longevity, but speakers and materials and things like that in here feel like a 25 to $45,000 car. A lot of fabric, a lot of plastic and recycled materials. Again, it's more about the aesthetic and I really like the way the things are laid out in here. This screen looks better even though it's running the same software. It looks better than the Ionic 5.\\n\\nIt's got these nice little winglets up to the side. It frames the display nicely like I have no complaints aesthetically. But there are going to be people who are like, well, I wish it was leather. I wish there was a little more fancy trim, little carbon fiber, a little bit of metal. And there isn't really any of that in here. But really the main thing that they did here that stands out versus the Ionic 5 is again, same software experience like there's a screen here and a screen here. The dash has all the same graphics and you still have the drive mode button where you can change it to sport mode and things turn red and these lights turn red. You can go to Eco mode. If you can hold it down long enough, you get to snow mode. You still have all the same software over here. You have car play and Android Auto, but it's wired, not wireless. You must plug in for that. Basically exact the same climate controls and all the same things that I liked versus didn't like over here. Fine. But really is they've moved all the stuff that's usually on the door over to the middle and they focus more stuff on the middle. So you feel kind of more like you're in a cockpit and it's a little more of a sporty driving experience if you will. So only thing over here is the door and the memory for the seats.\\n\\nOver here you have lock and unlock, window switches, window lock, break hold, cup holders, a whole bunch of storage in here, two USB C ports for power, your USB A port for your car player, Android Auto, and your wireless charger. Now this wireless charger spot, it's fine. I've been known to just drop my phone in there out of habit and unfortunately it does slide around just a little bit. It's much better than like playing it in a cup holder that you drive a little bit interestingly or having any fun in this car. This thing slides all over the place. But putting your phone in this wireless charger spot, there is enough traction, a little bit of grip that it doesn't really move very much, which is good. It also got a little bit of a light there. So yeah, all your controls are in the middle, a little bit of storage down here underneath, which is good to see. And that's the biggest difference on the interior layout versus ionic five. There's also a nice little LED strip here if you can see that. It looks a lot better at night. This feels like a car that if it if you gave me a certain budget to develop a car in this price range, $50,000, this is probably about where I'd end up, meaning I couldn't jump on the Tesla Supercharger network for free. But as this is as good as you can do as far as having a sporty aesthetic, having features like a sunroof that fully opens or is it a moonroof? We've been talking about this at the studio sunroof moonroof is both isn't neither.\\n\\nI don't know, but it opens, which is pretty sick. And you have a whole bunch of spacing. You have a back seat and you have a trunk and it's real. And this is a really nice minimal well laid out interior without being overly nice in the materials department, which would drive up the price. You can get a much nicer interior for $50,000, but then it won't be electric. So yeah, it's like as far as recommending something like this, the real question is like, if you spent $50,000 on a car like with this bother you or with that or that. Would any of that stuff really make you mad or would it just come down to the fact that now I have a sedan, it's a little sportier looking and the driving experience is kind of fire. So I've spent the better part of the last week driving this car, getting to know it, what it does well, what it doesn't. It does have the several driving modes like I mentioned. In regular driving mode, it feels just like a regular EV. It actually shows me my miles per kilowatt hour and it hovers around three miles per kilowatt hour. It's pretty efficient actually. And so you really do get like the true 250 miles of range driving in normal mode. The second you go to sport mode, it's really mostly just a different throttle map. Like I don't feel a big difference in suspension. It's not like everything lowers down to the ground and feels much tighter. It's more just like the accelerator pedal is more aggressive.\\n\\nAnd so as soon as you flip it, you feel the car sort of lurch forward and then you're in sport mode and things are pretty zippy. And you can very quickly start to explore the limits of what this drivetrain is capable of. It's not key at EV6 GT fast. It's barely Tesla Model 3 performance fast, but it is quite zippy, especially in the early zero to 40 mile an hour range. And that's where most of the fun is had in an EV like this sipping around the city, merging, getting on on ramps and things like that. It's like, yeah, this thing does does awesome for that. But yeah, I'm actually impressed that you are getting the true 250 miles that it's claiming to which I wish it was more, but at least it's true to what it's claiming. And the amount of regen that you can add is also really nice. So I was talking about these paddle shifters that they added behind the steering wheel before, which a couple of other EVs have. And like you switch it all the way to level four. And the most regen possible, it is very strong. It is very, very strong. And so the one pedal driving experience becomes awesome. And you can sort of flip that on and off for people with different levels of regen. So I like that a lot. It really is all about the aesthetics though, isn't it? I mean, it's on the same platform. It's running the same software. It's functionally an ionic five. Oh, it doesn't like when I do that. I don't like when I EV makes me hit the off button. It's an EV. It's a computer on wheels.\\n\\nYou know to turn off, right? Anyway. Yeah, aesthetically, it's very different. And I think I love it. So the question is, yeah, would you, would you go ionic five over ionic six? Would you go ionic six over ionic five? And if so, let me know why. Also, in shooting this video, I did something a little bit different. Actually, I did two things. One of them is a new microphone. Let me know if that helped. The other thing I'm not going to tell you. I just want to see if you can tell what's different about this video. Okay, that's pretty much it. Thanks for watching. Catch you guys later. Peace.\", metadata={'source': 'autofocus/Hyundai_IONIQ_6_is_an_Awesome_Design_.txt'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content=\"All right, today was a fun day because I got to spend some time with two of Lotus' new electric cars. Yeah, that Lotus, the one that's known for making ultra light sports cars and things like that, the ones that made the chassis for the original Tesla Roadster, it's kind of the antithesis of what we know Lotus to be, Lotus is typically making the lightest weight stuff, but this is, it just shows how obvious the electrification of the future of cars is. They're going right to Electric, not even Hybrids. So there's two out, there's an SUV that's been out on the road for a couple months now, and then there's a car, a sedan that is brand new, just got revealed. So they both look really sick, and the names are both really tough, but the sedan is called the Emea, EME YA. I got to sit in it, look around it, take a first look, that's the Super Sporty one, but then the SUV I got to drive. It's a little bit taller, but that's called the Electra, and that's one that's the more like wider appeal version. So this is it, the Emea, and it's honestly, it looks sick. Matter of fact, the three biggest things that I noticed, just around the outside of this car are one, it's a really good looking car, two, there's a lot of tech, but also a lot of analog, and then three, it just seems like there's a lot of moving parts, like a lot of moving parts, maybe some unnecessary, you'll see what I mean.\\n\\nSo yeah, first of all, clearly a good looking sedan, this thing, I don't think it has a bad angle, it's got like all these nice shapes and proportions all the way around. The driver sits pretty far forward, so kind of similar to a mid-engine car. The headlights are dope, it's got this twin daytime running light happening with these nice animations right above the actual headlights, I believe they're LED matrix headlights, and then across the back, there's a huge bar all the way across that actually doubles as a charge progress indicator. That shows real progress when the car is plugged in, so that's cool. There's carbon fiber everywhere from the rear splitter at the bottom of the side skirts to the front splitter. We'll get to the interior in a second, but there's carbon fiber there too. And then there's these huge sporty wheels, these are 22 inch lightweight performance wheels, wrapped in what looks like Michelin Pilot Sport EV LTS, which I've never heard of this tire before, but it's got all kinds of pilot sport 4S vibes, probably with some like lower rolling resistance optimizations, but these are some massive 305 millimeter wide tires on the back, and you can clearly see the high performance carbon ceramic brakes at all four corners too. This thing is non-messing around. Now, when I say that there's a lot of moving parts in this car, stick with me here. It gets kind of crazy, so first of all, the door handles is pretty normal.\\n\\nThey sit flush with the car until you get up to it with the key and then they pop open. We've seen that before, but that's a moving part. Then the power trunk lift gate is also very common, but that's another moving part. Good to see that there's a lot of space in here, and even a little room for some charging accessories, and a little sub-tronk area. But then the charge port cover is motorized instead of just a normal door. A little extra, but I guess it's nice to see in a car of this premium price. Then the car has lighter sensors all the way around for self-driving tech, but those cause a lot of drag when they're sticking out all the time. So just like the door handles, the ones on the front right, front left, and the top will also retract into the top and the sides of the car when they're not in use, which is again another moving part. Then there's an active rear wing, actually a sort of a pair of rear wings you can see in there that creates downforce, keeps the car planted at higher speeds, and that along with some moving parts below the car at the front and the back are going to be really good for stability. But then even the front of the car, even the grill up here, has a bunch of these smoothly moving parts to open and close the front, so it can be closed for less drag and better efficiency, or open for high performance driving to let more air through to cool the brakes and the batteries. And then the cherry on top is the power opening doors.\\n\\nSo all four doors you can open from either the display in the car or from an app, or just by pulling the door handle a little bit, and they will sense how much room they have and just motorized open as much as they can. And of course they can close with a button press as well, or just by putting your foot on the brake, but hey, now we're in this interior. Alright, so first of all, ignoring the fact that this is a right-hand drive car, because this is one of one Lotus prototype, and that's how they start things off, there's a ton of tech all around this car just absolutely loaded, and so I just want to show you guys some of the highlights, most of which I really like, some of which I have some questions about. So first of all, let's start with the screens. There's an OLED screen back behind the steering wheel here, shows your speed and range and stuff. There's a nice, pretty thin bezel OLED in the center, which is really responsive. It's running Unreal Engine, I am told, and that's a twin model of the car right there with all the controls, which I'll get to in a second. And then there's another screen over there on the left, passenger screen, right. Then there's an HUD behind the steering wheel, which is apparently a 55-inch equivalent field of view. I don't know exactly how to measure that, but it looks pretty crisp from where I'm sitting.\\n\\nThen there is a Qi wireless charger in here, there is your HVAC controls, which is just physical buttons, and then a bunch of LED lights that respond to the physical button presses, which is kind of neat. But then there's always a cloud and fiber trim, an actual gear selector here, but also physical park and hazards. Then this cool cup holder design, so if you want cup holders, you got them, but if you don't, you get rid of them, neat. And then there's some surge in the center, and I'll get to the back seat later. Above my head is an electrochromatic roof that is fully tinted right now and fully adjustable. Not on this prototype, but on the screen you'll be able to do that. That's super cool. There are a ton, a ton of speakers all around this cabin, from the side to the front to the doors, I mean, they're everywhere. By K-E-F, I believe is the brand name, here they are. K-E-F. I've never heard K-E-F speakers, and I want to hear these, but there's a ton of them, so I have high hopes. There's another one up at the front there. But some stuff that I'm kind of curious about, one, you see in a lot of these prototypes, instead of having mirrors, it's got cameras, and it's got these blind spot monitoring cameras right where you would look to see the mirrors. And they work super, super well, and they're actually legal in a lot of places, but not here yet.\\n\\nSo I believe that basically they'll have a trim piece, maybe some metal here, and an actual mirror in the car in the US, at least until that regulation changes. And then the other thing that I'm kind of curious about here is a steering wheel, really nice racing type steering wheel, Alcantara little center notch up here, and then there's some paddle shifters, and when I looked at these, I was like, oh, this is nice, these are metal, and the left side is regen up and down, so you can change the amount of regenerative braking, now on the right side, drive mode selector up and down. That's pretty fire. Voice controls as well, regular stocks for headlights and blinkers. But okay, here's a part that I'm a little bit mixed about. I'm kind of torn because this here is sweet. This is the smoothest UI. I've so far really ever seen in any car for all your controls, but you can change your driving modes here from track to sport to individual. As I do that, you get a whole bunch of settings changing. The suspension height is changing. Even the seat, it changes the amount that it's hugging me. So I'm in sport right now. I'm going to hit that track button, let's see if you can see it. He can't really see it, but it started hugging me more, like both stirring me more, into the seat. That is super cool. But then this is the HVAC controls. So we've seen this before. You've got your actual vents here for the HVAC. They're all around the car like normal.\\n\\nBut if you want to change the direction at the air flows, it's on the touchscreen again. So it's kind of this weird mix of, oh, I can change my temperature at any time, really easily here. Changes the red to go up, blue to go down, love that. But then if I want to turn off event, it's a touchscreen thing. So not in love with that, but that's the way they've decided to do it here. And then a whole bunch of other controls here for just car stuff in general. You can change all the ambient lighting colors. There's LEDs all over the cabin. It's red now. Now it's blue. Now it's pink. You can do whatever you want here in the entire cabin response. All your vehicle controls up here and opening and closing the trunk. And even changing the arrow. So on the back of the car, if you want to just put up the rear spoilers because you like the way they look, you can do that. I am super into how responsive this is. I have a feeling it's going to be much better for the final customer because they'll actually be able to connect to the internet and do navigation and things like that. But generally, good to see it. So I'm in the back seat now. Couple things again that I notice. Really nice build quality. Still speakers everywhere. Pretty good amount of headroom. I'm also behind the six three driving position. And there's a good amount of near room here. But the floor is really high. And there's not much space underneath the seat here. So I do feel like I can't extend my legs very much.\\n\\nI'd be comfortable here for a little bit, but not any type of long road trip. Again, it's a driver's car. I'm not shocked by that. But that's something I've noticed. But then ton of carbon fiber here. This huge electromagnetic roof all the way behind my head. These seats are really nice, lots of materials. And they're kind of bucket-y, not full bucket. But they're kind of bucket-y in a sporty way, which I like. Then they've got this screen here with controls. So this is the two seat rear option. They will have a three seat version. But as of right now, if you pick the two seat sort of executive seat option, this whole center column is taken up here. There's even more speakers in here. More fancy cup holders and LED lights and ventilation. And controls for the ventilation is by this touch screen. Here's another moving part for you. Hit that button right there. And this sort of elevates. Again, carbon fiber trim, really high quality. But it's another moving part. Then you've got this nice super smooth storage. I mean, that might be the smoothest center storage I've ever seen. It's totally silent. And then look behind me. There's like a water bottle holder. Maybe one or two water bottles in there. It stays open. Spring load shut. Super cool. This is a nice rear seat, especially for a car. That again is 900 plus horsepower, super sporty, bucket seats, driver focused, racing features. But not an entirely terrible back seat. Respectable. But honestly, who cares about the back seat?\\n\\nThis is a driver focused car, after all. That's why it has dual motors and 900 plus horsepower. That's why it does zero to 60 in under three seconds. That's why it has carbon ceramic brakes and custom tires and active arrow and active air suspension. In addition to the real pass through vents at the front, underneath the headlights, and at the back. Like if I had the car wow stick of truth here, you would see that these vents are very real. All of this is part of Lotus's DNA of making drivers cars. So, you know, to fill that for myself, it was time to switch to actually driving around an electric Lotus. This time, the SUV, the slightly higher off the ground, Lotus Electra. So, first thing I actually notice is there are one, two, three, four levels of regen. Off, one, two, or three. And all the way up on three in torque mode, it's in like one pedal driving. It's basically you can let off the accelerator and this thing will come all the way down slowly to a stop. But when I'm in sport mode, I realize the regen is not as strong. You can't really one pedal drive in sport mode. The maximum regen you get is not as strong, which is interesting. It reminds me kind of of somewhere in between the Taycan because of the handling and the EV6 GT for its impressive acceleration and just fun driving characteristics, just by being high off the ground. But thing about driving an electric car is you can never really say it feels light. It doesn't feel light. Sorry, Lotus, it doesn't feel light.\\n\\nSorry, Lotus fans. This is going to be the first Lotus somebody drives when they're like, well, it can't really hide how happy it is. But the suspension, I think what you really find is it's stronger and more technically impressive in the way it handles how much weight is being thrown at it. So it's still a good suspension. It's still good steering. It's just not the same as a really lightweight car would feel. I actually kind of wish that the screen in front of the steering wheel was bigger. Most tax kilometers and like dashboard screens behind the steering wheel are bigger than this. Here's a suspension that just apparently a thousand times per second. And very quickly too, like it can change ride heights from the lowest to the highest and back to the lowest in like a second or two. So that's pretty cool. The steering you can go from sport to tour. You can change active rear spoiler to be sporty. But I always leave it in sport power. Why ever turn the power down? So okay, I have listened to the speakers now. And they're really good. Really, really loud. There's also a ton of them like there are, I think several subwoofers. I don't know the exact layout, but there's a Dolby Atmos set up. There are speakers in this middle console here. Speakers around me. Speakers above me. Speakers behind me. When the bass is all the way up, I can see the mirror rattling. Like it's, it's allowed very, very solid speaker system.\\n\\nBut I think that's what people when they pay for they want to hear. This is good. It's also got special idea of sport. It sounds really good. And of course, the main thing that's kind of like an X variable with these is the range. It's basically going to look somewhere between 260 miles to like 300 miles, depending on your wheel size. So this has got to be huge 23 inch wheels on it. And it's showing me with a full battery and touring load like 275 miles of range. If you put it in sport mode, you won't get as much. But if you had 20 inch wheels, you could get even more. So you're looking at, yeah, up to probably 300 miles of range. Lotus right now is not yet on the list of car companies who have signed up to use Tesla's NACS sport. And so this one as of right now behind yet another moving part is CCS sport. And we'll do 350 kilowatt charging. And that will get it from like 10 to 80 percent, like 15 minutes or something crazy. It's very fast. There's 100 kilowatt hour battery. Very fast charging. But I do wonder if you want to get something like this. If you're going to road trip, you probably do want to hear that it will support NACS as of right now. But the one thing I did here will support at some point ideally with a software update. I don't know if these have gotten software updates yet, but they say that they will add Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. I believe that is also wireless. So your phone can sit on the wireless charger here.\\n\\nAnd you'll have those two things available to you as of right now. This shipping card doesn't have that. And the ones that I played with don't have that. Fingers crossed. Fingers on the steering wheel though. This is a nice steering wheel. Wow, wow. You know what else is crazy? You can actually feel when it shifts gears. So there are two years. This is similar to the Taycan again. It's dual motors, front motor and rear motor. And the rear motor has two speeds. And when you see what speed it happens, you actually feel the shift between first gear and second gear. Let me get a little bit of room. Okay, it's like it's a little over the speed limit that it happens. But you can feel that difference, that little shift. I don't know if it's intentional that they added that shift, but you can feel the shift. All right, one track mode full acceleration. Wow, wow. Yeah, it's got it. It's got it. It's got it. Man, if you really want an electric SUV, if that's specifically what you're in the market for, as of right now, there's not a ton of options. But of your options, I mean, you have Ionic 5, you have EV6, you have a lot of 50 to 70,000 dollar options. And then you kind of get up to like Tesla Model X plaid, Rivian R1S and this. And of those, this is the most fun to drive. This is more fun to drive than the Tesla. The Model X does accelerate harder. No doubt about it. I am ruined by the plaid, triple motor powertrain acceleration.\\n\\nBut that thing is nowhere near as stable, nowhere near as comfortable driving, nowhere near as good handling as this. And this is definitely more fun to drive. So if you're going to spend more, I love the R1S. That's my favorite in this segment of what they do. But this is the most fun to drive. And that's what it's made for. I'm impressed. I have my doubts, obviously, about a lot of the moving parts being a little bit unnecessary and a lot of the extra things that this car does, that it doesn't have to do. But that's kind of the point of getting into cars up in this price, this 80 to 100 plus thousand dollar car, when it's a Lotus, when it's a sports vehicle, you want it to feel special. And this does a lot of that. And it just kind of speaks for the whole electrification of everything that every car company is doing across the board. It doesn't matter who, doesn't matter if it's Lotus, the company who you thought would never make a heavy car ever, everyone's doing it. And it's just a matter of how they do it. And I think they've done this pretty well for their first try. I'm not going to lie. Thanks for watching. Catch you in the next one.
